                                                    <h5>Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>HOLLYWOOD, Calif., June 18--Ethel Barrymore, last of the trio known to Broadway and Hollywood as &quot;The Royal Family&quot; of acting, died here today of a heart ailment. She would have been 80 years
                                                        old on Aug. 15.</p>
                                                    <p>Miss Barrymore started on the stage at 14 and made her last public appearance on television during a testimonial to her on her seventy-eighth birthday. The two others in the Barrymore triumvirate were
                                                        her brothers, John, who died in 1942, and Lionel, who died in 1954.</p>
                                                    <p>Although Miss Barrymore talked amusingly of the past, she refused to live in it and had little patience for those who resented changes in drama brought on by movies and television. In one of her last
                                                        interviews, several weeks ago, she said:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;We must recognize that change is not going to appeal to us personally if we are irrevocably determined to abide by the traditional standards of taste.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The square-jawed actress with the classical profile had done no acting for movies since 1954, when she made &quot;Young At Heart,&quot; with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day. She took her final acting role
                                                        on television in a &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; dramatization in 1956.</p>

                                                    <p>Critics have written of weeping from the beginning to the end of a play Miss Barrymore acted and forgetting completely to follow the plot. Clifford Odets has told the story of trying to select a pathetic

                                                    <p>Miss Barrymore was described by Harold Clurman, author and critic, as possessing a naturally regal quality that was as easy and organic for her as breathing.

She was asked once what she did when playgoers began coughing in the theatre. &quot;I never let them cough,&quot; she replied, then added: &quot;They don&apos;t dare!&quot;

But, as one admirer noted, it did not merely make a rich sound--it was the echo of an inexhaustible wealth of experience. It was the echo of a life Miss Barrymore once
                                                        thought of describing as &quot;Too Many Tears&quot; in her biography, but later decided to call &quot;Memories&quot; because of her reticence about the expression of her private emotions.</p>

                                                        Miss Barrymore, who was born in Philadelphia on Aug. 15, 1879, was 14 when she decided it was time to think about earning a living. She left the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Philadelphia to join her grandmother, Mrs. John Drew Sr., one of the first
                                                        of the outstanding American actresses. Miss Barrymore made her debut in New York in the role of Julia in &quot;The Rivals,&quot; at the now defunct Empire Theatre on Jan. 25, 1894.

                                                    <p>She was watched, carefully, by the critics. Her father was Maurice Barrymore, a matinee idol and a Beau Brummel of his day, and her mother was the lovely Georgiana Drew, whose family for generations
                                                        had been among the elite of the theatre. Her mother&apos;s brother was John Drew and her great-grandmother, Eliza Lane, was an English actress and singer of note. These were her antecedents, and
                                                        the critics were curious.</p>
                                                    <p>It was not a particularly brilliant debut, and managers did not rush to add this latest Barrymore to their lists of stars. But John Drew, whose leading lady then was the celebrated Maude Adams, found
                                                        a small part for her in his vehicle &quot;The Bauble Shop,&quot; and Charles Frohman, the producer, saw her and though she might do.</p>
                                                    <p>She was on her way. A few years, first, of small parts, tours and little cash. But she began to attract favorable attention and, in 1901, rose to stardom when Mr. Frohman gave her the leading role of
                                                        Mme. Trentoni in &quot;Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines.&quot;
