                                                    <p>GUAM, April, 18--Ernie Pyle died today on Ie Island, just west of Okinawa, like so many of the doughboys he had written about. The nationally known war correspondent was killed instantly by Japanese
                                                        machine-gun fire.

                                                        Corps.

Our men had seemingly ironed out minor opposition at this point, and Mr. Pyle went over to talk to a regimental commanding officer. Suddenly enemy machine gunners
                                                        opened fire at about 10:15 A.M. (9:15 P.M., Tuesday, Eastern war time). The war correspondent fell in the first burst.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Pyle had just talked with a general commanding Army troops and Lieut. Col. James E. Landrum, executive officer of an infantry regiment, before &quot;jeeping&quot; to a forward command post with Lieut. Col. Joseph B. Coolidge of Helena, Ark., commanding
                                                        officer of the regiment, to watch front-line action.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Colonel Coolidge was alongside Mr. Pyle when he was killed. &quot;We were moving down the road in our jeep,&quot; related Colonel Coolidge. &quot;Ernie was going with me to my new command post. At 10
                                                        o&apos;clock we were fired on by a Jap machine gun on a ridge above us. We all jumped out of the jeep and dived into a roadside ditch.</p>
                                                    <b>May Be Buried Where He Fell</b>
                                                    <p>&quot;A little later Pyle and I raised up to look around. Another burst hit the road over our heads and I fell back into the ditch. I looked at Ernie and saw he had been hit.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;He was killed almost instantly, the bullet entering his left temple just under his helmet.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;I crawled back to report the tragedy, leaving a man to watch the body. Ernie&apos;s body will be brought back to Army grave registration officers. He will be buried here on Ie Jima unless we are
                                                        notified otherwise.

                                                    <p>&quot;I was so impressed with Pyle&apos;s coolness, calmness and his deep interest in enlisted men. They have lost their best friend.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Colonel Coolidge was visibly shaken as he told the facts of the columnist&apos;s death. Almost tearfully, he described the tragedy. He said he knew the news would spread swiftly over the island.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The general also was visibly upset as he read a message about Mr. Pyle&apos;s death. He said:</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I am terribly sorry to hear this news. Just before Ernie went up this road [pointing toward the front lines] he talked with me and Colonel Landrum at this command post, and Ernie made arrangements to meet me back here at 3 o&apos;clock. I told him
                                                        if he was not here on time I couldn&apos;t wait for him, as I had to be back on my flagship.&quot;

                                                        While the general was talking soldiers standing near by were grieved to hear of Mr. Pyle&apos;s death. A short distance ahead enemy machine guns and our own guns and artillery were rattling and roaring. Soldiers exhibited &quot;short-snorter&quot; bills
                                                        that the writer had signed for them less than an hour before.

                                                    <p>Mrs. Pyle said she had been notified of his death before it was announced in Washington.

                                                    <p>Ernie Pyle was haunted all his life by an obsession. He said over and over again, &quot;I suffer agony in anticipation of meeting people for fear they won&apos;t like me.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        No man could have been less justified in such a fear. Word of Pyle&apos;s death started tears in the eyes of millions, from the White House to the poorest dwellings in the country.

                                                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt once wrote in her column &quot;I have read everything he has sent from overseas,&quot; and recommended his writings to all Americans.

                                                        In the Eighth Avenue subway yesterday a gray-haired woman looked up, wet-eyed, from the headline &quot;Ernie Pyle Killed in Action&quot; and murmured &quot;May God rest his soul&quot; and other women, and men, around her took up the words. This was typical.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>It was rather curious that a nation should have worked up such affection for a timid little man whose greatest fear was &quot;Maybe they won&apos;t like me.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Yet this fear had started in childhood. Ernie Pyle was born on Aug. 3, 1900, in a little white farmhouse near Dana, Ind., the only child of William and Maria Taylor Pyle.

                                                        They were simple people, content to spend their lives in the little white house on the dusty Indiana country road, as William Pyle&apos;s parents had spent their lives.

                                                        horizons. </p>

                                                        Ernie was likely to be off in a corner, smiling and affable, but silent.

                                                    <p>He took journalism, incidentally, not because he had any burning desire for a career in it, but because it was rated then as &quot;a breeze.&quot; He had no flaming ambition for anything. </p>
                                                    <p>He quit college in 1923, a few months before graduation, to work as a cub on The La Porte (Ind.) Herald-Argus and moved on a few months later to a desk job on The Washington (D. C.) News.

Blown out of press headquarters at Anzio, almost killed by our own planes at St. Lo, he told of the death, the heartache and the agony about him and always he named names of the kids around

                                                    <p>He had frequent premonitions of death. He said: &quot;You begin to feel that you can&apos;t go on forever without being hit. I feel that I&apos;ve used up all my chances, and I hate it. I don&apos;t

                                                    <p>&quot;Ernie Pyle was a great reporter,&quot; Mr. Dewey said. &quot;His warm, human stories of our fighting men-- Ernie&apos;s beloved GI&apos;s--had become an integral part of our American life. Every
                                                        day millions of American newspaper readers eagerly read his column, which was a daily link between us here on the home front and our men fighting on the battlefronts of the world.&quot;

                                                    <p>&quot;Ernie Pyle was Albuquerque&apos;s adopted son, and all of us sorely grieve his passing,&quot; said former Governor Clyde Tingley, Mayor of Albuquerque.</p>

                                                    <p>FIFTEENTH ARMY GROUP HEADQUARTERS, Italy, April 18 (UP)--General Mark W. Clark paid tribute today to Ernie Pyle in the following message:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;A great soldier correspondent is dead, perhaps the greatest of this war. I refer to Ernie Pyle, who marched with my troops through Italy, took their part and championed their cause both here and
                                                        at home.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;His reporting was always constructive. He was &quot;Ernie&quot; to privates and generals alike. He spoke the GI&apos;s language and made it a part of the everlasting lore of our country. He was
                                                        a humble man and in his humility lay his greatness.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;He will be missed by all of us fighting with the Fifteenth Army Group. There could have been only one Ernie Pyle. May God bless his memory. He helped our soldiers to victory.&quot;
