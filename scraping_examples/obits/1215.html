                                                    <h5>By ALDEN WHITMAN</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        J. Paul Getty, a symbol of oil, wealth and power, died early today at his country mansion near London. He was 83 years old. The cause of death was reported to be heart failure.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        An American by birth, Mr. Getty had lived in Britain for nearly 25 years. He had been in failing health for several months.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Business associates who announced Mr. Getty&apos;s death said that the directors of the Getty Oil Company, of which Mr. Getty was still president, had already provided for the delegation of authority within the company and that normal business operations
                                                        would continue.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The precise extent of Mr. Getty&apos;s wealth was difficult to compute, but in 1974 business associates put his fortune at from $2 billion to $4 billion. He had a majority or controlling interest in the Getty Oil Company and nearly 200 other concerns.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Mr. Getty tended to be reclusive in his last years. He spoke several times of wanting to return to Southern California, where he had lived for many years--but he never did.

                                                        A note of gone- are-the-better-days crept into his response. &quot;I would hope to realize several billions,&quot; he said. &quot;But, remember, a billion dollars isn&apos;t worth what it used to

Hardships of Fame

                                                        Mr. Getty, of course, did not sell out, and seven or eight years later, when his fortune had very much and very visibly increased, he was complaining of the hardships of wealth and the fame that accompanied it. The fame, it appeared, had generated the
                                                        hardships. But these were not so great as to make them unbearable, nor to render fame less desirable than obscurity.

He was also known by some newspaper readers for his purchase of the Pierre Hotel in New York and for his five marriages and an equal number of divorces.
                                                        Once, however, the awesome vastness of his riches was made generally known he acquired celebrity. This he burnished by writing articles in mass-circulation magazines and by putting his name to two

He balked on the ground that &quot;I have 14 other grandchildren and if I pay one penny now, then I&apos;ll have 14 kidnapped

                                                        Most people, the oilman said he had discovered after 1957, were &quot;so economically illiterate that they assume most of my fortune is in cash,&quot; whereas in fact all the folding money he had was a million dollars; and that was so parsimoniously budgeted
                                                        by his accountants that he rarely carried more than $25 in his pockets.

Recounting his plight in a magazine article entitled &quot;It&apos;s Tough to Be a Billionaire,&quot; Mr. Getty said

                                                        Was being so rich worth all the trouble? Mr. Getty was asked when he attained the age of 73. &quot;Though our rewards may be small,&quot; he said of himself and his fellow Midases, &quot;we are, if our society is to remain in its present form, essential
                                                        to the nation&apos;s prosperity. We provide others with incentives which would not exist if we were to disappear.&quot;

                                                        a spot at Mina Saud on the Persian Gulf, and a 15th-century palace and nearby castle at Ladispoli, on the coast northwest of Rome. He first began to occupy his Italian estate in 1966, when the rigors
                                                        of British winters drove him from London.

Previously he had led a restless life, running his business for many years from hotel suites. After World War II, he virtually expatriated himself from the United States. He could usually
                                                        be found in those years at the George V in Paris or the Ritz in London.

He also substituted a highly mechanized team of four gardeners for the previous 24 who had tended the 700-acre, two-swimming-pool estate, on which there
                                                        were also 30 cottages and lodges, tennis courts and a trout stream.

An elaborate security system was installed, and every room, including the 14 bathrooms (one of them with gold fixtures) was wired. Windows and doors were
                                                        barred, too; and &apos;No Trespass&apos; signs were erected to warn visitors of the giant Alsatian dogs that had the run of the place.</p>

He was a somber man who stood imposingly at 5 feet 11 inches and who weighed a muscular 180 pounds. A long fleshy nose dominated his pale, stern face with its pinched
                                                        lips. He had blue eyes beneath heavy lids. His hair, which he touched up from time to time, was dark and carefully brushed. When he wore gold-rimmed spectacles for reading he looked rather professorial.
                                                        Indeed, he possessed a keen mind and a tenacious memory--one so full of detail, it was said, that he could recite with ease the circumstance of complex financial dealings.

                                                        ancient Greek without too many hesitations.

He ate health foods, chewing each mouthful 33 times; munched maple sugar candy between meals, worked at Bernarr Macfadden body-building exercises and walked two miles a day wearing a pedometer to calculate
                                                        his mileage.

He also liked to practice the prerogatives of wealth by attending splendid social gatherings and by escorting comely women many years his junior to parties. He was
                                                        a friend of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and of many correspondingly notable and fashionable people here and abroad.

Mr. Getty started his collection in the nineteen- thirties. He purchased the house and 60-acre ranch near Los Angeles in 1943,
                                                        and later he added the gallery wing. At that time he placed the estate under a trust fund as the J. Paul Getty Museum, which was opened to the public in 1954. Some art objects were given to the Los

                                                    <p>
                                                        Sharpening his oil talents to the point of genius in the nineteen-twenties, Mr. Getty accumulated about $3 million, including a one-third interest in a company that was to evolve into the Getty Oil Company. Mr. Getty&apos;s father was pleased by his son&apos;s
                                                        business acumen but shocked by his marriages, and when he died in 1930 he left his son only $500,000 of an estate of $10 million. Most of the estate, which had sprung from a $5,000 oil investment
                                                        in 1903, went to Paul Getty&apos;s mother.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In the Depression he picked up the Pacific Western Oil Corporation, a holding company with large oil reserves and a heavy cash balance. He also dickered with his mother to win a controlling interest in the Getty concern. Then, in a drawn-out series of
                                                        maneuvers in which he displayed an extraordinary patience and shrewdness, he obtained control, by 1953, of the Mission Corporation and its holdings in Tidewater Oil (then called Tide Water Associated
                                                        Oil Company) and Skelly Oil Company.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        These companies with their reserves, refineries and retail businesses eventually became part of a pyramid of corporations, at whose apex stood the Getty Oil Company, which was more than 80 percent owned by Mr. Getty. They constituted the chief ingredients
                                                        of his fortune in the United States.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In a complicated rearrangement in 1967, Mr. Getty merged the Tidewater Oil Company and the Mission Development Company into the Getty Oil company. The surviving company then had assets of more than $3 billion, a figure since multiplied after oil price
                                                        increases in 1973. Shortly afterward, he estimated that his profits were 10 percent of assets.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Getty was asked then what satisfaction he derived from making so much money.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;It is just to prove that you can keep step with the regiment,&quot; he replied, alluding to Exxon, Gulf and Texaco, the other giant oil corporations, he seemed to regard as his rivals.

Book on Oil Business

                                                    <p>
                                                        In the years Mr. Getty was wheeling in oil stocks and battling Standard Oil for control of Tidewater and Skelly, he lived mostly in an enormous penthouse at 1 Sutton Place, New York, that he had leased from Mrs. Frederick Guest. He conducted a vigorous
                                                        social life there and also found time to write his first book, &quot;History of the Oil Business of George Franklin Getty and J. Paul Getty, 1903-39.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He also got into the hotel business in that period by purchasing the Pierre at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street for $2,350,000 in 1938. Twenty years later he sold most of the suites to residents while retaining, through a subsidiary company, the service rooms--the
                                                        bars, restaurants and reception rooms.

                                                        To the rear of the Pierre, at 600 Madison Avenue, is the 22-story Getty Building, which he built in the late fifties and which he owned through Getty Oil. He also owned, again through corporate devices, a skyscraper in Los Angeles, an office building
                                                        in Tulsa and the Pierre Marques Hotel at Revolcadero Beach near Acapulco, Mexico.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The day the United States entered World War II, in 1941, Mr. Getty dispatched a telegram to an old friend, Under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. The message, quoted in Mr. Getty&apos;s autobiography read:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I am 49 but in good health, have owned three yachts and am experienced in their care and maintenance. If Navy can use me in any capacity, please advise. Regards.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Navy rejected him for sea duty, but Secretary Frank Knox suggested he do something about the Spartan Aircraft Company, a Skelly and hence Getty subsidiary in Tulsa. He did, and in the war Spartan manufactured trainers and plane parts under Mr. Getty&apos;s
                                                        personal direction. Afterward, the company converted profitably to production of mobile homes.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In the postwar years Mr. Getty executed the most daring coup of his business career when, in 1949, he obtained a 60-year concession in Saudi Arabia&apos;s half of the Neutral Zone, a barren tract lying between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in which no oil
                                                        had been discovered. He paid King Saud $9.5 million in cash for the concession and agreed to pay $1 million a year for its duration whether or not oil was struck.

</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After an investment of $30 million, the gamble paid off when the Getty interests hit oil in enormous quantities in 1953. Production from that field, which was in excess of 16 million barrels a year, helped to elevate Mr. Getty into the billionaire class.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In addition to his holdings in oil (including a tanker fleet with a ship named for him), real estate, trailer homes and hotels, Mr. Getty had interests in the Minnehoma Insurance Company and the Spartan Cafeteria Company, all in Oklahoma.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Getty&apos;s ability (and agility) in amassing his fortune awed most of his business contemporaries. &quot;He is comparable to Henry Ford, Commodor Vanderbilt or Andrew Mellon,&quot; one Wall Street broker said.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His sons were awed, too. One of them, George, who died in 1973, once put it this way:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Mr. Getty is the smartest businessman I know. Coming to see him is like visiting Mount Olympus.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Getty was inclined to agree that he occupied some sort of special status, although he was modest in his expression. &quot;I&apos;m a bad boss,&quot; he said self-analytically. &quot;A good boss develops successors. There is nobody to step into my
                                                        shoes.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Getty is survived by three sons, J. Ronald Getty, J. Paul Getty Jr., and Gordon Peter Getty, 16 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.</p>
