He lived to become the first president of the modern state of Israel and to see pour into its borders the hundreds of thousands
                                                        of homeless, abandoned European Jews.

His life epitomized the task of all of them in transforming Palestinian deserts into sections of rolling forests, lush olive and orange groves,
                                                        irrigation and water- power projects, and centers of science and industry in the undeveloped Middle East.

He isolated certain organisms found in cereals and horse chestnuts

His father was a timber merchant, of modest means, who managed with his wife the remarkable task of sending nine of their fifteen children to universities. He went first to

When a favorite professor joined the staff of the University of Freiburg in Switzerland, Dr. Weizmann went there to study.
                                                        He received a doctorate in science in 1900.

Sought Jewish State in 1919

He accepted at that time the principle of partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states provided that
                                                        the Jews were free to form a &quot;free national unit.&quot; On Nov. 30, 1947, the U. N. General Assembly approved partition, and Jews danced in the streets of Tel Aviv.

This proposal was turned down, and on May 14, 1948, simultaneously with the withdrawal of the British from Palestine, the
                                                        Provisional Government of the new State of Israel was created.

This came after he had talked with President Truman during his visit here to participate
                                                        in celebrations commemorating the first anniversary of the founding of the new State of Israel on May 4.

And it was two months later that he participated in ceremonies when the body of Theodore Herzl was brought &quot;home&quot; to Israel

Construction of the institute started in 1944 and each
                                                        year large sums of money were contributed here toward additional buildings.
