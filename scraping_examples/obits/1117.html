                                                        Lee Strasberg, father of &apos;&apos;Method acting&apos;&apos; in America, artistic director of the Actors Studio, stage director, film actor and a major figure in world theater, died of a heart attack yesterday. He was 80 years old. </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Strasberg, as a master teacher, guided several generations of actors, including Marlon Brando, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. He revolutionized the art of acting and had
                                                        a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The Method, a system of vocal, physical and emotional exercises, was initiated in Russia by Constantin Stanislavsky; it encouraged the actor to use his psyche and subconscious in preparing for a role.
                                                        Mr. Strasberg adapted it to the American theater, imposing his refinements, but always crediting Stanislavsky as his source. </p>

By the time he arrived at the hospital, there were no vital signs and, according to

                                                    <p> Ironically, he made his earliest professional appearances as an actor in the mid-1920&apos;s, singing and dancing in theatricals such as the &apos;&apos;Garrick Gaieties.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> He soon moved from acting to directing and teaching, but in 1974 returned to acting and made his film debut in &apos;&apos;Godfather II,&apos;&apos; a role for which he received an Academy Award nomination
                                                        for supporting actor. He subsequently performed in other films, including &apos;&apos;The Cassandra Crossing,&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Boardwalk,&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;And Justice for All,&apos;&apos;

His pupils were also his disciples. To many of them, he was a principal motivating

                                                    <p>Born Israel Strassberg on Nov. 17, 1901, in Budzanow, Poland, now part of the Soviet Union, he was the son of a provincial innkeeper. At the age of 7, he emigrated with his family to the United States,
                                                        where his father worked in the garment industry. Growing up on the Lower East Side, he attended the theater whenever possible and joined the Chrystie Street Settlement&apos;s drama group as an actor.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> It was at that time that he changed his name to I. Lee Strasberg, subsquently dropping the initial. He worked as a wigmaker; studied improvisational acting techniques with Richard Boleslavsky, a student
                                                        of Stanislavsky, and began working as an actor. He made his professional debut in &apos;&apos;Processional,&apos;&apos; produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925, and was also assistant stage manager
                                                        for the Lunts in &apos;&apos;The Guardsman.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Working for the guild, he met, among others, Harold Clurman. In his book &apos;&apos;The Fervent Years,&apos;&apos; Mr. Clurman recalled his first impression of Mr. Strasberg on stage in a play by Pirandello,
                                                        &apos;&apos;as a young, pale-faced man of intellectual demeanor.&apos;&apos; Meeting him, Mr. Clurman said, &apos;&apos;we were drawn together by our common dissatisfactions, our still unshaped ideals.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b> In Search of a Responsive Theater 
</b>
                                                    <p> Those ideals took shape with the formation of the Group Theater, founded in 1931 by Mr. Clurman, Mr. Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal moment in the growth of American performing arts,
                                                        bringing together actors, directors and writers in search of a theater that would be responsive to society. </p>
                                                    <p> Their production was Paul Green&apos;s &apos;&apos;The House of Connelly,&apos;&apos; directed by Mr. Strasberg. As Mr. Clurman said: &apos;&apos;Lee Strasberg is one of the few artists among American
                                                        theater directors. He is the director of introverted feeling, of strong emotion curbed by ascetic control, sentiment of great intensity muted by delicacy, pride, fear, shame. The effect he produces
                                                        is a classic hush, tense and tragic, a constant conflict so held in check that a kind of beautiful spareness results. The roots are clearly in the intimate experience of a complex psychology, an
                                                        acute awareness of human contradiction and suffering.&apos;&apos;

</b>
                                                    <p> Mr. Clurman&apos;s description of his friend as director bears a direct relationship to Mr. Strasberg&apos;s subsequent work at the Actors Studio. The Method requires that an actor in preparing for a
                                                        role delve not only into the character&apos;s life in the play, but also, far more importantly, into the character&apos;s life before the curtain rises. In rehearsal, the character&apos;s prehistory,
                                                        perhaps going back to childhood, is discussed and even acted out. The play became the climax of the character&apos;s existence.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Brando based his acting technique on the Method. &apos;&apos;It made me a real actor,&apos;&apos; he once said. &apos;&apos;The idea is you learn to use everything that happened in your life and
                                                        you learn to use it in creating the character you&apos;re working on. You learn to dig into your unconscious and make use of every experience you ever had.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p>Kim Stanley, explaining what she learned at the studio, has said: &apos;&apos;Lee tries to make you find things in yourself that you can use. In this respect, it&apos;s not unakin to analysis. The times
                                                        I most fulfilled myself were the times I remembered what Lee told us in class - to do the work &apos;moment by moment,&apos; to allow yourself to look and listen.&apos;&apos;</p>
                                                    <b>Controversial Teachings </b>
                                                    <p> Throughout Mr. Strasberg&apos;s career, his teachings were controversial. Opponents of the Method believe that it encourages actors to be self-indulgent, to forget the character in pursuit of behavorial
                                                        motivation, and that it does not prepare actors to play classics. Stereotypically, opponents contend, the Method actor is mannered to the point of unintelligibility.

                                                        On the other hand, Tennessee Williams, whose plays have been populated by graduates of the studio, has said studio actors had a more intense and honest style of acting. &apos;&apos;They act from the inside out,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;They communicate
                                                        emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Strasberg was not a founder of the studio; it was created in 1947 by Elia Kazan, Mr. Crawford and Robert Lewis. But in a year, Mr. Srasberg had joined the three, associates from the now defunct Group
                                                        Theater, and he soon became the guiding force. He remained synonomous with its work for the rest of his life.</p>

                                                        The first role of the studio, he said, was to perceive talent before it was fully trained. Among the many actors who have worked at the studio are Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman,
                                                        Patricia Neal, Rod Steiger, Mildred Dunnock, Eva Marie Saint, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Ben Gazzara, Sidney Poitier, Karl Malden, Shelley Winters and Sally Field.

                                                        productions that generally disappointed the critics. From that time, most plays were performed as in-house projects in the studio&apos;s home at 432 West 44th Street. Mr. Strasberg retained his hope
                                                        that the studio could become the basis for a national theater.
