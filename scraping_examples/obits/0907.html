                                                        HOOSICK FALLS, N. Y., Dec. 13--Grandma Moses, the spry, indomitable &quot;genuine American primitive&quot; who became one of the country&apos;s most famous painters in her late seventies, died here today at the age of 101.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        She died at the Hoosick Falls Health Center, where she had been a patient since August, after a fall at her home in nearby Eagle Bridge. Her physician, Dr. Clayton E. Shaw, said she had died of hardening of the arteries, but the best way to describe the
                                                        cause of death, he suggested, was to say &quot;she just wore out.&quot;

                                                        The simple realism, nostalgic atmosphere and luminous color with which Grandma Moses portrayed homely farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She was able to capture the excitement of winter&apos;s first snow, Thanksgiving preparations
                                                        and the new, young green of oncoming spring.

                                                        Gay color, action and humor enlivened her portrayals of such simple farm activities as maple sugaring, soap-making, candle-making, haying, berrying and the making of apple butter.
                                                    </p>

Crippled by Arthritis

                                                        Grandma Moses, whose paintings hang in nine museums in the United States and in Vienna and Paris, turned out her first picture when she was 76 years old.

                                                        She took up painting because arthritis had crippled her hands so that she no longer could embroider. She could not hold a needle, but she could hold a brush, and she had been too busy all her life to bear the thought of being idle.

Caldor, who was driving through Hoosick Falls saw some of her paintings displayed in a drug store. They were priced from $3 to $5, depending on size. He bought them all, drove to the artist&apos;s
                                                        home at Eagle Bridge and bought ten others she had there.

                                                        A German fan offered his explanation for her wide popularity:

                                                        &quot;There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is good. You feel at home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us
                                                        inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses.&quot;

                                                        as well as to Breughel. Until the comparisons were made, she had never heard of either artist.

Painted from Remembrance

                                                        Grandma Moses did all of her painting from remembrance of things past. She liked to sit quietly and think, she once said, and remember and imagine. &quot;Then I&apos;ll get an inspiration and start painting; then I&apos;ll forget everything, everything
                                                        except how things used to be and how to paint it so people will know how we used to live.&quot;

The Masonite on which she painted would lie flat on an old kitchen table before her. There was no easel. Crowding her in her &quot;studio&quot; were an electric washer and
                                                        dryer that had overflowed from the kitchen.

                                                        For subject matter, Grandma Moses drew on memories of a long life as farm child, hired girl and farmer&apos;s wife. Her first paintings had been sent to the county fair along with samples of her raspberry jam and strawberry preserves. Her jam had won
                                                        a ribbon, but nobody noticed those first paintings.

                                                        to see horses.

She painted from the top down: &quot;First the sky, then the mountains, then the hills,
                                                        then the trees, then the houses, then the cattle and then the people.&quot; Her tiny figures, disproportionately small, cast no shadows. They seem sharply arrested in action.

He was a Methodist, but never went to church, and he allowed his children to believe what they wanted. Instead of going to church, they went for long walks in the

During her lifetime she painted more than 1,000 pictures, twenty-five of them after she had passed her 100th birthday.
                                                        Her oils have increased in value from those early $3 and $5 works to $8,000 or $10,000 for a large picture.

                                                        For her work, the painter received honorary doctoral degrees from Russell Sage College in 1949 and from the Moore Institute of Art, Science and Industry, Philadelphia, in 1951.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;The death of Grandma Moses removed a beloved figure from American life. The directness and vividness of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to our perception of the American scene. Both her work and her life helped our nation renew its
                                                        pioneer heritage and recall its roots in the countryside and on the frontier. All Americans mourn her loss.&quot;
