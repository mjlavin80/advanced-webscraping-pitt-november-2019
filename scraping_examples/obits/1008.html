He had entered the auto industry as a trainee mechanic and made his first

His transfer to actual combat flying--in which he shot down 22 German planes and four observation balloons--was complicated not only by his being two

                                                        In the highly competitive airline business, Mr. Rickenbacker was the first man to prove that airlines could be made profitable, and then the first to prove that they could be run without a Government subsidy and kept profitable. This, despite a previous

In any kind of fight he neither
                                                        asked for nor gave quarter. His opposition to Government &quot;interference&quot; was widely known, as were his outspoken objections to subsidies for industries or individuals. He was also an intransigent

In 1963, when he retired as board chairman of Eastern Air Lines he announced that he would devote himself to &quot;awakening the American public

McCarthy, and he urged United States withdrawal from the United Nations, the severance

                                                        larded with paternalism. He frequently referred to his employes as &quot;the boys and girls,&quot; but he devoted much of his time to pushing, prodding and cajoling them into making the same efforts

                                                    <p>
                                                        Part of this heroism was in the military field. When he was given command of a fighter squadron on Sept. 24, 1918, he wrote in his diary:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        He did not delay suiting action to the words. The next day, while leading a patrol before breakfast, he spotted a flight of five German Fokker pursuit planes escorting two observation craft near Billy, France. He slammed his Spad fighter into a power
                                                        dive, coming down out of the sun onto the unsuspecting enemy. Closing fast, he fired a long burst and saw one of the Fokkers fall away and crash.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Taking advantage of the momentary confusion of the German fighter pilots, he plunged through their formation and went after the two-seater observation planes, which were then streaking back toward enemy territory. He made several unsuccessful passes at
                                                        the heavier craft while their rear gunners were firing at him and the entire dogfight moved behind the German lines.

                                                        When he saw that the Fokkers had regrouped and were closing fast at higher altitude, he decided to make one final try. Sideslipping his Spad between the two observation planes, which were flying about 50 feet apart, he sent one down in flames before streaking
                                                        for home.

                                                        This double-header, as he called it, earned him the Medal of Honor, but at the time Mr. Rickenbacker had other things on his mind. &quot;I was glad it had come this morning [MISSING TEXT] effect it would have on the other pilots,&quot; he said.
                                                    </p>

                                                        His determination to set a good example did not end with the twin killing. He went on to achieve 18 of his 26 victories between taking command of the Squadron and the end of the war--a matter of 48 days in all. Much of his combat was against the &quot;flying
                                                        circus&quot; of Baron Manfred von Richtofen, the &quot;Red Baron.&quot;

In 1960, the Air Force approved his request for correction of the official record
                                                        and granted him his 26th kill.</p>

Although he was pinned to the body of a dead steward by the wreckage and had a shattered pelvic bone,
                                                        half a dozen broken ribs, a broken leg and one eyelid torn away, he remained conscious for nine hours until he was taken to a hospital.

In minutes the plane sank and its eight passengers and crewman took to rubber

He divided the four oranges that made up the initial food supply. When a seagull landed on his head, he captured the bird smoothly. Then, when fish were caught, he

Hating him every minute, six of these seven survived to be rescued
                                                        by a patrolling plane that found them almost by chance. Most of them came to believe that they owed their lives to Mr. Rickenbacker&apos;s iron will.

When Mr. Frayer moved a short time later to the Columbus Buggy Company, just beginning the

He hurried home and tried to interest the War Department in organizing an air squadron of former racing drivers. Failing this, he enlisted on May 27, 1917,
                                                        as a sergeant in the Signal Corps and sailed for France as General Pershing&apos;s chauffeur.

They resented his civilian fame and his undeniable cockiness about it. In addition, he was regarded as uncouth, domineering and profane. To top it off, he insisted on
                                                        checking his plane engine before every flight and personally supervised the loading of machine- gun bullets in his ammunition belts, instead of relying on the fortunes of war as gallantry dictated.

                                                        The first Rickenbacker victory came on April 29, 1918, while on a patrol with the squadron commander, the late Capt. James Norman Hall, who later wrote &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; with Charles Nordhoff. He dived his Nieuport to within 150 yards of
                                                        a German Albatross before opening fire.

And when Captain Hall was shot down and captured by the Germans, Captain Rickenbacker, who
                                                        by then was an ace with seven confirmed kills, was promoted to command the 94th.

                                                        In 1934 he was sent as a trouble-shooter to salvage what he could of General Motors&apos; Eastern Air Transport Division, which then owned Eastern Air Lines jointly with North American Aviation.

Mr. Rickenbacker&apos;s job was to shore
                                                        up the failing line so the owners could sell it for their $1-million asking price.

The second year he doubled the profits. By the third year, when the Government ordered G. M. to sell its airlines
                                                        or get out of aircraft manufacturing, a banking syndicate offered more than $3-million for Eastern.

                                                        Mr. Rickenbacker pleaded with his employers for an equal chance to &quot;save the airline for the boys and girls who helped build it.&quot; He received 60 days to raise the money and was told the company would be his for $3.5-million. The night before
                                                        the option expired he got his final commitment, and the next day, March 2, 1938, he owned Eastern Air Lines.

                                                        Mr. Rickenbacker ran his company in much the same manner he had commanded the 94th Squadron in World War I. He set impossible goals, and then went out and achieved them himself before complaints got out of hand. He also applied other early lessons to
                                                        the airlines. He was never the first to buy a new plane. Only when other companies had tested a new type and proved it satisfactory did he place his order.

In the eyes of many travelers, its lack of emphasis on in-flight service and other frills
                                                        gave it a spartan image.

                                                        Nevertheless, the airline prospered. For 25 years under Mr. Rickenbacker&apos;s guidance-- from 1935 to 1960--it earned a profit every year. Then, along with many other lines that were jolted by the financial headwinds accompanying the introduction of
                                                        jet airliners, it experienced losses during the early sixties.
