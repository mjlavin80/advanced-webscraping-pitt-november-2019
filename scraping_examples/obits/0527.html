                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Rachel Carson, the biologist and writer on nature and science, whose book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; touched off a major controversy on the effects of pesticides, died yesterday in her home in Silver
                                                        Spring, Md. She was 56 years old.</p>
                                                    <p>Her death was reported in New York by Marie Rodell, her literary agent. Miss Rodell said that Miss Carson had had cancer &quot;for some years,&quot; and that she had been aware of her illness.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>With the publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; in 1962, Rachel Louise Carson, the essence of gentle scholarship, set off a nationally publicized struggle between the proponents and opponents of the
                                                        widespread use of poisonous chemicals to kill insects. Miss Carson was an opponent.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Some of Miss Carson&apos;s critics, admiringly and some not so admiringly, compared her to Carrie Nation, the hatchet-wielding temperance advocate.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This comparison was rejected quietly by Miss Carson, who in her very mild but firm manner refused to accept the identification of an emotional crusader.

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Chemicals are the sinister and little-recognized partners of radiation in changing the very nature of the world--the very nature of life.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The sprays, dusts and aerosols are now applied almost universally to farms, gardens, forests and homes--non-selective chemicals that have the power to kill every insect, the good and the bad, to

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Can anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life? They should not be called &apos;insecticides&apos; but

                                                    <p>The chemical industry was quick to dispute this.</p>
                                                    <p>Dr. Robert White-Stevens, a spokesman for the industry, said:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson&apos;s book, &apos;Silent Spring,&apos; are gross distortions of the actual facts, completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence, and general
                                                        practical experience in the field. Her suggestion that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without selective biologicals these compounds
                                                        would be completely useless.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The real threat, then, to the survival of man is not chemical but biological, in the shape of hordes of insects that can denude our forests, sweep over our crop lands, ravage our food supply and
                                                        leave in their wake a train of destitution and hunger, conveying to an undernourished population the major diseases scourges of mankind.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Monsanto Company, one of the nation&apos;s largest chemical concerns, used parody as a weapon in the counterattack against Miss Carson. Without mentioning her book, the company adopted her poetic style in an article labeled &quot;The Desolate Year,&quot;
                                                        which began: &quot;Quietly, then, the desolate year began . . .&quot; and wove its own apocalyptic word picture--but one that showed insects stripping the countryside and winning.

                                                    <p>&quot;We must have insect control,&quot; she reiterated. &quot;I do not favor turning nature over to insects. I favor the sparing, selective and intelligent use of chemicals. It is the indiscriminate,
                                                        blanket spraying that I oppose.&quot;</p>

                                                        Actually, chemical pest control has been practiced to some extent for centuries. However, it was not until 1942 that DDT, a synthetic compound, was introduced in the wake of experiments that included those with poison gas. Its long-term poisonous potency
                                                        was augmented by its ability to kill some insects upon contact and without being ingested. This opened a new era in pest control and led to the development of additional new synthetic poisons far
                                                        more effective even than DDT.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>One of Miss Carson&apos;s greatest fans, according to her agent, Marie Rodell, was her mother. Miss Rodell recalled that the mother, who died of pneumonia and a heart ailment in 1960, had sat in the
                                                        family car in 1952 writing letters while Miss Carson and Miss Rodell explored the sea&apos;s edge near Boothbay Harbor. To passers-by the mother would say, pointing, &quot;That&apos;s my daughter,
                                                        Rachel Carson. She wrote &apos;The Sea Around Us.&apos;&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>People remembered Miss Carson for her shyness and reserve as well as for her writing and scholarship. And so when she received a telephone call after the publication of &quot;The Sea Around Us,&quot;
                                                        asking her to speak in the Astor Hotel at a luncheon, she asked Miss Rodell what she should do.</p>
                                                    <p>The agent counseled her to concentrate on writing. Miss Carson nodded in agreement, went to the phone, and shortly came back and said somewhat helplessly: &quot;I said I&apos;d do it.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There were 1,500 persons at the luncheon, Miss Carson was &quot;scared to death,&quot; but she plunged into the talk and acquitted herself. As part of her program she played a recording of the sounds of underseas, including the clicking of shrimp and
                                                        the squeeks of dolphins and whales. With the ice broken as a public speaker, Miss Carson continued with others sporadically.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Did Research by Herself</b>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson had some preliminary help in researching &quot;Silent Spring&quot; but soon found that she could go faster by doing the work herself because she could skim past so much that she already knew.</p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson had few materialistic leanings. When she found &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; was a great financial success, her first extravagance was the purchase of a very fine binocular- microscope, which
                                                        she had always wanted. Her second luxury was the summer cottage on the Maine coast.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Her agent said that Miss Carson&apos;s work was her hobby but that she was very fond of her flower garden at Silver Spring, Md., where she also loved to watch the birds that came to visit. </p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson had two favorite birds, a member of the thrush family called the veery, and the tern, a small, black-capped gull-like bird with swallowlike forked tails.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        She once told an interviewer that she was enchanted by the &quot;haunting, mystical call&quot; of the veery, which is found in moist woods and bottomlands from Newfoundland to southern Manitoba, and in mountains to northern Georgia.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In manner, Miss Carson was a small, solemn-looking woman with the steady forthright gaze of a type that is sometimes common to thoughtful children who prefer to listen rather than to talk. She was politely
                                                        friendly but reserved and was not given to quick smiles or to encouraging conversation even with her fans.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The most recent flare-up in the continuing pesticide controversy occurred early this month when the Public Health Service announced that the periodic huge-scale deaths of fish on the lower Mississippi River had been traced over the last four years to
                                                        toxic ingredients in three kinds of pesticides. Some persons believed that the pesticides drained into the river from neighboring farm lands.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>A hearing by the Agriculture Department of the Public Health Service&apos;s charges ended a week ago with a spokesman for one of the pesticide manufacturers saying that any judgment should be delayed
                                                        until more information was obtained.</p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson was born May 27, 1907, in Springdale, Pa., the daughter of Robert Warden Carson and the former Maria McLean. She was brought up in Springdale and in nearby Parnassus.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>She owed her love of nature in large measure to her mother, who once wrote in The Saturday Review of Literature, that she had taught her daughter &quot;as a tiny child joy in the out-of-doors and the
                                                        lore of birds, insects, and residents of streams and ponds.&quot; She was a rather solitary child. She never married.</p>
                                                    <p>After being graduated from Parnassus High School, she enrolled in the Pennsylvania College for Women at Pittsburgh with the intention of making a career of writing. First she specialized in English composition.
                                                        Later biology fascinated her and she switched to that field, going on to graduate work at Johns Hopkins University.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>She then taught for seven consecutive sessions at the Johns Hopkins Summer School. In 1931 she became a member of the zoology staff of the University of Maryland. She remained five years. Her Master
                                                        of Arts degree was conferred by Johns Hopkins in 1932.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Meanwhile, a childhood curiosity about the sea stayed with her. She absorbed all that she could read about the biology of the sea and she undertook post-graduate work at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., at Cape Cod.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In 1936 she was offered a position as aquatic biologist with the Bureau of Fisheries in Washington. She continued with the bureau and its successor, the Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1937, an article,
                                                        &quot;Undersea,&quot; in Atlantic led to her first book, &quot;Under the Sea Wind,&quot; in 1941, and this was followed by her appointment as editor in chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service--blending
                                                        her two worlds: biology and writing.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The Sea Around Us,&quot; published in 1951, made her world famous, and she received numerous honors. They included the Gold Medal of the New York Zoological Society, the John Burroughs Medal, the
                                                        Gold Medal of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia and the National Book Award.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Meanwhile, in 1952, she resigned from her government post to continue her writing. She was no armchair naturalist. To gain experience the hard way, she once sailed in a fishing trawler to the rugged
                                                        Georges Banks off the Massachusetts coast. &quot;The Edge of the Sea&quot; was published in 1955, and before long she was at work researching material for &quot;Silent Spring.&quot;

                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Rachel Carson, the biologist and writer on nature and science, whose book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; touched off a major controversy on the effects of pesticides, died yesterday in her home in Silver
                                                        Spring, Md. She was 56 years old.</p>
                                                    <p>Her death was reported in New York by Marie Rodell, her literary agent. Miss Rodell said that Miss Carson had had cancer &quot;for some years,&quot; and that she had been aware of her illness.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>With the publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; in 1962, Rachel Louise Carson, the essence of gentle scholarship, set off a nationally publicized struggle between the proponents and opponents of the
                                                        widespread use of poisonous chemicals to kill insects. Miss Carson was an opponent.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Some of Miss Carson&apos;s critics, admiringly and some not so admiringly, compared her to Carrie Nation, the hatchet-wielding temperance advocate.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This comparison was rejected quietly by Miss Carson, who in her very mild but firm manner refused to accept the identification of an emotional crusader.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson&apos;s position, as a biologist, was simply that she was a natural scientist in search of truth and that the indiscriminate use of poisonous chemical sprays called for public awareness of
                                                        what was going on.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        She emphasized that she was not opposed to the use of poisonous chemical sprays--only their &quot;indiscriminate use,&quot; and, at a time when their potential was not truly known.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Quoting Jean Rostand, the French writer and biologist, she said: &quot;The obligation to endure gives us the right to know.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>On April 3, 1963, the Columbia Broadcasting System&apos;s television series &quot;C.B.S. Reports&quot; presented the program &quot;The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson.&quot; In it, Miss Carson said:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when
                                                        in full possession of the facts.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;We still talk in terms of conquest. We still haven&apos;t become mature enough to think of ourselves as only a tiny part of a vast and incredible universe. Man&apos;s attitude toward nature is today critically important simply because we have now

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Chemicals are the sinister and little-recognized partners of radiation in changing the very nature of the world--the very nature of life.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Can anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life? They should not be called &apos;insecticides&apos; but

                                                    <p>Dr. Robert White-Stevens, a spokesman for the industry, said:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson&apos;s book, &apos;Silent Spring,&apos; are gross distortions of the actual facts, completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence, and general
                                                        practical experience in the field. Her suggestion that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without selective biologicals these compounds
                                                        would be completely useless.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The real threat, then, to the survival of man is not chemical but biological, in the shape of hordes of insects that can denude our forests, sweep over our crop lands, ravage our food supply and
                                                        leave in their wake a train of destitution and hunger, conveying to an undernourished population the major diseases scourges of mankind.&quot;</p>

                                                        The Monsanto Company, one of the nation&apos;s largest chemical concerns, used parody as a weapon in the counterattack against Miss Carson. Without mentioning her book, the company adopted her poetic style in an article labeled &quot;The Desolate Year,&quot;
                                                        which began: &quot;Quietly, then, the desolate year began . . .&quot; and wove its own apocalyptic word picture--but one that showed insects stripping the countryside and winning.

                                                    <p>&quot;We must have insect control,&quot; she reiterated. &quot;I do not favor turning nature over to insects. I favor the sparing, selective and intelligent use of chemicals. It is the indiscriminate,
                                                        blanket spraying that I oppose.&quot;</p>

                                                        Actually, chemical pest control has been practiced to some extent for centuries. However, it was not until 1942 that DDT, a synthetic compound, was introduced in the wake of experiments that included those with poison gas. Its long-term poisonous potency
                                                        was augmented by its ability to kill some insects upon contact and without being ingested. This opened a new era in pest control and led to the development of additional new synthetic poisons far
                                                        more effective even than DDT.

                                                        and Olga Huckins. It told of the destruction of aerial spraying had caused to their two-acre private sanctuary at Powder Point in Duxbury, Mass.</p>

                                                        Rachel Carson. She wrote &apos;The Sea Around Us.&apos;&quot;

As part of her program she played a recording of the sounds of underseas, including the clicking of shrimp and
                                                        the squeeks of dolphins and whales. With the ice broken as a public speaker, Miss Carson continued with others sporadically.

                                                        she had always wanted. Her second luxury was the summer cottage on the Maine coast.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Her agent said that Miss Carson&apos;s work was her hobby but that she was very fond of her flower garden at Silver Spring, Md., where she also loved to watch the birds that came to visit. </p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson had two favorite birds, a member of the thrush family called the veery, and the tern, a small, black-capped gull-like bird with swallowlike forked tails.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        She once told an interviewer that she was enchanted by the &quot;haunting, mystical call&quot; of the veery, which is found in moist woods and bottomlands from Newfoundland to southern Manitoba, and in mountains to northern Georgia.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In manner, Miss Carson was a small, solemn-looking woman with the steady forthright gaze of a type that is sometimes common to thoughtful children who prefer to listen rather than to talk. She was politely
                                                        friendly but reserved and was not given to quick smiles or to encouraging conversation even with her fans.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The most recent flare-up in the continuing pesticide controversy occurred early this month when the Public Health Service announced that the periodic huge-scale deaths of fish on the lower Mississippi River had been traced over the last four years to
                                                        toxic ingredients in three kinds of pesticides. Some persons believed that the pesticides drained into the river from neighboring farm lands.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>A hearing by the Agriculture Department of the Public Health Service&apos;s charges ended a week ago with a spokesman for one of the pesticide manufacturers saying that any judgment should be delayed
                                                        until more information was obtained.</p>
                                                    <p>Miss Carson was born May 27, 1907, in Springdale, Pa., the daughter of Robert Warden Carson and the former Maria McLean. She was brought up in Springdale and in nearby Parnassus.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>She owed her love of nature in large measure to her mother, who once wrote in The Saturday Review of Literature, that she had taught her daughter &quot;as a tiny child joy in the out-of-doors and the
                                                        lore of birds, insects, and residents of streams and ponds.&quot; She was a rather solitary child. She never married.</p>
                                                    <p>After being graduated from Parnassus High School, she enrolled in the Pennsylvania College for Women at Pittsburgh with the intention of making a career of writing. First she specialized in English composition.
                                                        Later biology fascinated her and she switched to that field, going on to graduate work at Johns Hopkins University.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>She then taught for seven consecutive sessions at the Johns Hopkins Summer School. In 1931 she became a member of the zoology staff of the University of Maryland. She remained five years. Her Master
                                                        of Arts degree was conferred by Johns Hopkins in 1932.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Meanwhile, a childhood curiosity about the sea stayed with her. She absorbed all that she could read about the biology of the sea and she undertook post-graduate work at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., at Cape Cod.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In 1936 she was offered a position as aquatic biologist with the Bureau of Fisheries in Washington. She continued with the bureau and its successor, the Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1937, an article,
                                                        &quot;Undersea,&quot; in Atlantic led to her first book, &quot;Under the Sea Wind,&quot; in 1941, and this was followed by her appointment as editor in chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service--blending
                                                        her two worlds: biology and writing.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;The Sea Around Us,&quot; published in 1951, made her world famous, and she received numerous honors. They included the Gold Medal of the New York Zoological Society, the John Burroughs Medal, the
                                                        Gold Medal of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia and the National Book Award.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Meanwhile, in 1952, she resigned from her government post to continue her writing. She was no armchair naturalist. To gain experience the hard way, she once sailed in a fishing trawler to the rugged
                                                        Georges Banks off the Massachusetts coast. &quot;The Edge of the Sea&quot; was published in 1955, and before long she was at work researching material for &quot;Silent Spring.&quot;
