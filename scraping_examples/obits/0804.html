                                                    <p>Louis Armstrong, the celebrated jazz trumpeter and singer, died in his sleep yesterday morning at his home in the Corona section of Queens. He had observed his 71st birthday Sunday.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Death was attributed to a heart attack. Mr. Armstrong had been at home since mid-June when he was discharged from Beth Israel Medical Center after 10 weeks of treatment for heart, liver and kidney disorders.
                                                        He seemed in good health during an interview June 23, in which he played his trumpet and announced his intention to return to public performances. </p>
                                                    <p>President Nixon released this statement:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Nixon and I share the sorrow of millions of Americans at the death of Louis Armstrong. One of the architects of an American art form, a free and individual spirit, and an artist of worldwide
                                                        fame, his great talents and magnificent spirit added richness and pleasure to all our lives.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Tributes to Mr. Armstrong also came from a number of leading musicians, including Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, Al Hirt, Earl (Fatha) Hines, Tyree Glenn and Eddie Condon.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Ellington commented: &quot;If anybody was Mr. Jazz it was Louis Armstrong. He was the epitome of jazz and always will be. He is what I call an American standard, an American original.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;I never tried to prove nothing, just always wanted to give a good show. My life has been my music, it&apos;s always come first, but the music ain&apos;t worth nothing if you can&apos;t lay it on
                                                        the public. The main thing is to live for that audience, &apos;cause what you&apos;re there for is to please the people.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Armstrong was first and most importantly a jazz trumpet player without peer, a virtuoso soloist who was one of the most vivid and influential forces in the development of American music.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>But he was also known to delighted millions around the world for his ebulliently sandpapery singing voice, his merry mangling of the English language and his great wide grand-piano keyboard of a smile.

                                                        jazz in the company of gamblers, pimps and prostitutes.

                                                    <p>But in time he was to play his trumpet and sing in command performances before royalty and, through his numerous worldwide tours, to become known unofficially as &quot;America&apos;s ambassador of goodwill.&quot;</p>

                                                    <p>Jazz experts, even the purists who criticized Mr. Armstrong for his mugging and showmanship, more often than not agreed that it was he, more than any other individual, who took the raw, gutsy Negro folk
                                                        music of the New Orleans funeral parades and honky-tonks and built it into a unique art form.

                                                    <p>Over the years, his life and his artistry changed radically. He left New Orleans for Chicago in the early nineteen-twenties, when he was still playing the cornet, and before 1930 made some of his most
                                                        memorable recordings--with his Hot Five or Hot Seven groups.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Armstrong won his initial fame playing an endless grind of one-night stands. Under constant pressure to put on a show that made the customers tap their feet and cry for more, he did not hesitate
                                                        to exploit a remarkable flair for showmanship. His mugging, his wisecracking and most of all his willingness to constantly repeat programs that had gone over well in the past won him the cheers of
                                                        his audiences, along with the disapproving clucks of some of his fellow musicians and jazz specialists.

                                                    <p>&quot;It is difficult. . .to see in correct perspective Armstrong&apos;s contribution as the first vital jazz soloist to attain worldwide influence as trumpeter, singer, entertainer, dynamic show business
                                                        personality and strong force in stimulating interest in jazz.

                                                        vocal qualities accepted outside the jazz world, had a rhythmic intensity and guttural charm that induced literally thousands of other vocalists to imitate him, just at countless trumpeters through
                                                        the years reflected the impact of his style.

                                                        reaction of a minority of musicians and specialists.&quot;
