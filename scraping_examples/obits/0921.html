He spent most of his birthday on the veranda of the farmhouse home or being wheeled about the garden in an invalid chair to which he had been largely restricted
                                                        after having undergone an operation on July 20. The operation was to correct a fracture of the femur suffered in a fall in his home a few days earlier.

His family he characterized in his memoirs as &quot;sturdy, middle-class people, religious, thrifty, energetic and long-lived&quot; New England stock. Henry Stimson&apos;s father had made enough
                                                        money as a banker in his early career to permit him to enjoy the luxury of studying medicine in Zurich and Paris and establishing a large and extremely unlucrative practice in New York.

He was elected near the end of his junior year to Skull and Bones, oldest of the senior societies. He was graduated in 1888. After two years
                                                        at Harvard Law School he was admitted to the bar in New York in 1891. By the end of 1905, as a member of Senator Root&apos;s law firm, he was making some $20,000 a year, and in January, 1906, President
                                                        Theodore Roosevelt appointed him United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, his first public post. The salary was half what he had been making in private practice.

Mr. Stimson put up a hard fight and spent so much
                                                        time preparing his speeches that T. R. said: &quot;Darn it, Henry, a campaign speech is a poster, not an etching.&quot; Mr. Stimson was defeated decisively by John A. Dix, the Democratic candidate.

                                                        of McKinley and Roosevelt, had taken the far-reaching step of forming the Army&apos;s first General Staff.

Major Gen. Leonard Wood was Chief of Staff when Mr. Stimson became Secretary
                                                        of War, and with Wood&apos;s aid the new Secretary was able to effect a new and more-efficient regrouping of the nation&apos;s tiny forces. But the nation was almost completely uninterested in army

                                                        President Taft, whose conservatism was somewhat more to his liking than Colonel Roosevelt&apos;s vigorously liberal attitudes. It was with genuine regret that Mr. Stimson felt obliged to throw his

                                                        had diminished during the Democratic administration of the islands. Upon the death of General Wood, President Coolidge appointed Mr. Stimson his successor.

Secretary of State in &apos;31

                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Stimson was Secretary of State during the 1931 Manchurian crisis, which with the Ethiopian crisis of 1936 and the Munich appeasement of 1938, constituted the major retreats made by the Western powers before the nationalistic aggression that led to
                                                        the second World War. President Hoover, who himself had considerable personal knowledge of Far Eastern affairs, had great confidence in Mr. Stimson&apos;s judgment in this field and gave him virtually
                                                        a free hand. The Manchurian storm broke almost without warning.

                                                    <p>
                                                        On Sept. 17, 1931, Mr. Stimson received Katsuji Dubuchi, Japanese Ambassador, and both agreed that tensions in the Far East seemed to be relieved and that Japanese-American relations were much improved. Two days later Japanese troops occupied the Manchurian
                                                        arsenal city of Mukden and other points in south Manchuria, territory claimed by China.

                                                        Secretary Stimson obtained Government approval for his plan to try to check Japan&apos;s Manchurian advance by cooperating with the supposedly moderate Baron Kijuro Shidehara, Japan&apos;s Foreign Secretary. To this end Mr. Stimson refrained from public
                                                        criticism of Japan&apos;s Manchurian aggression and at the same time conveyed through discreet diplomatic channels indications of keen American interest in Manchurian developments.

                                                        Mr. Stimson expounded the doctrine by non-recognition of conquests by aggression, which was adopted without dissent by the League of Nations Assembly on March 11.

                                                        Japanese aggression spread, in spite of the diplomacy of the Hoover administration, and Mr. Stimson was forced to adopt a firmer tone. He sought to enlist Britain and other interested European powers in a joint stand against Japan, and he was surprised
                                                        and disappointed when all found reasons for declining to back the publicly taken American position. The last remnant of China&apos;s authority in Manchuria disappeared on Jan. 3, 1932, when the Japanese
                                                        occupied Chinchow.

                                                        At that time it was widely believed that United States diplomacy had received one of the sharpest setbacks in American history. A large part of the American press, opposed to Mr. Hoover&apos;s administration, was furious at the spectacle of apparent American
                                                        impotence in the Far East. The Secretary of State was widely referred to as &quot;Wrong Horse Harry&quot; Stimson. Subsequent event convinced many diplomats, however, that Japan had been so determined
                                                        upon a course of aggression that nothing short of war would have checked her course, and the United States was in no way prepared for such a war.

                                                        Secretary Stimson made a trip to Europe in 1933 to learn at first hand the problems and personalities involved in the darkening international scene. In a conversation with the German statesman, Heinrich Bruening, at Geneva, Mr. Stimson said that &quot;the
                                                        situation in the world seemed to me like the unfolding of a great Greek tragedy, where we could see the march of events and know what ought to be done, but seemed to be powerless to prevent its marching
                                                        to its grim conclusion.&quot;

                                                        Although Secretary Stimson admired President Hoover and of course supported him in the 1932 campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt, he also had profound respect for Governor Roosevelt. An embarrassing situation was created when President Hoover asked
                                                        Secretary Stimson to make a speech in New York State attacking Governor Roosevelt as an administrator. Mr. Stimson flatly declined to do, although he expressed his willingness to make speeches supporting
                                                        Mr. Hoover&apos;s policies.

                                                        After serving as a liaison man between President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt between election and inauguration days, Mr. Stimson retired to private life, but was not forgotten by President Roosevelt.

                                                        The beginning of the second World War in 1939 found the War Department split by a feud between Secretary of War Harry H. Woodring and Assistant Secretary Louis Johnson. In a typically Rooseveltian stroke of political daring, the President decided to invite
                                                        Mr. Stimson to accept the War post which the harassed Secretary Woodring finally vacated. It was formally offered in a telephone call from President Roosevelt on June 19, 1940. At the same time another
                                                        Republican, Frank Knox of Chicago, was invited to become Secretary of the Navy, and accepted.

                                                        Mr. Stimson was 73 years old when he accepted the colossal task of carrying forward his country&apos;s preparation for taking part in a war from which it was almost certain that it could not keep free. He was remembered for the failure of his Manchurian
                                                        policy, and his advanced years caused it to be said openly in Washington that he would collapse under the strain.

                                                        With an energy that would have been astonishing in a man twenty years younger, Secretary Stimson grappled with the task of making the ground and army air forces ready for almost certain war service. When he had been Secretary of War in 1911, there had
                                                        been almost endless time to prepare for war, but no money. Now there was almost inexhaustible money and no time.

United States Attacked by Japan

                                                        The Japanese attacked us on Dec. 7, 1941, and then and later, Mr. Stimson became involved in the controversy over who was to blame for the fact that the American land and sea forces were surprised at Pearl Harbor. Secretary Stimson maintained that Lieut.
                                                        Gen. Walter Short, commanding in Hawaii, had been adequately warned before the attack. Another and very tenacious school of thought held that the warning had not been sufficiently explicit.

                                                        As the European war developed, Secretary Stimson became convinced that victory lay in a direct invasion from England. He threw his weight against Prime Minister Winston Churchill and others who favored diversions via the Mediterranean through Central
                                                        Europe. Those who agreed with Mr. Stimson had their way, but not until the disagreement had become so keen that Mr. Stimson suggested in exasperation that the United States abandon Europe as the
                                                        main conflict theatre and concentrate on the Pacific war.

The ultimate responsibility for the recommendation to the President rested upon me, and I have no desire to veil it. The conclusions of the committee were similar to my own, although
                                                        I reached mine independently.&quot;

                                                        Secretary Stimson selected four targets, two of which were subjected to the atomic bomb attack--Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later. Both attacks caused great loss of life among civilians as well as among members of the Japanese armed
                                                        forces and also vast property damage.
