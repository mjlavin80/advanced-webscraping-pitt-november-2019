                                                    <p>
                                                        LOS ANGELES, March 28--Jim Thorpe, the Indian whose exploits in football, baseball and track and field won him acclaim as one of the greatest athletes of all time, died today in his trailer home in suburban Lomita. His age was 64.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe was eating dinner with his wife when he suffered a heart attack. Mrs. Thorpe&apos;s screams attracted a neighbor, Colby Bradshaw, who administered artificial respiration for nearly half an hour.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A county fire rescue squad took over and was momentarily successful. Thorpe revived, recognized persons around him and spoke to them. He was conscious for only a brief time before he suffered a relapse and died.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Hero of the 1912 Olympic Games at Stockholm and a towering football figure, Jim Thorpe was probably the greatest natural athlete the world had seen in modern times.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>King Gustaf V of Sweden said to the black-haired Sac and Fox Indian as he stood before the royal box, &quot;Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.&quot; That was after Thorpe almost single-handedly
                                                        gained the Olympic honors for the United States, setting a point-total record never before approached and dominating the games as no other figure.</p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe came back from Stockholm with $50,000 worth of trophies. They included a Viking ship presented to him by the Czar of Russia, and gifts from King Gustaf.</p>
                                                    <p>A month later the new American sports idol was toppled from his high pedestal when the Amateur Athletic Union filed charges of professionalism against him, accusing him of receiving pay for playing summer
                                                        baseball with the Rocky Mount Club in the Eastern Carolina League. The amount of money was negligible, helping to tide him over at school, but the American Olympic Committee offered its apologies
                                                        and sent back the gifts and medals lavished upon the young man to whom President Theodore Roosevelt had cabled long messages of congratulation.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The medals were forwarded to the runners-up in the pentathlon and decathlon events at Stockholm. Thorpe had won four of the five events in the Pentathlon and finished third in the other, a record unequaled to this day, and in the decathlon he scored 8,412
                                                        out of a possible 10,000 points, also unequaled.

                                                        Nurmi--declared that &quot;Jim Thorpe could still beat them all.&quot;</p>

                                                    <p>Before leaping into world-wide fame as the star of the Olympics Thorpe had become a national sports figure through his deeds on the gridiron as a member of the famous Carlisle Indians football teams
                                                        coached by Glenn S. (Pop) Warner. In 1911 and 1912 he was chosen as halfback on Walter Camp&apos;s All-America teams. </p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe played professional football for almost fifteen years and in his prime at Carlisle and as a pro he never had to leave the field because of an injury, such was his courage and stamina. In his last

                                                        hockey, archery, rifle shooting, canoeing, handball, swimming and skating.</p>

                                                    <p>He could run the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat, the 220 in 21.8, the 440 in 50.8, the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35, the 120-yard high hurdles in 15 seconds and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24 seconds.
                                                        He broad-jumped 23 feet 6 inches and high-jumped 6 feet 5 inches. He pole-vaulted 11 feet, put the shot 47 feet 9 inches, threw the javelin 163 feet, the hammer 140 feet and the discus 136 feet.</p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe was born on a farm at Prague, Okla., the son of Hiram Thorpe, a ranchman. Dutch, Welsh and Irish blood were understood to flow in his veins, but he was predominantly Indian. As might have been
                                                        expected he learned to ride, swim and shoot almost as soon as he could walk, and he was punching cattle at the age of 10. His favorite diversion was following his hunting dogs in the forest, which
                                                        helped to develop his magnificent body.</p>

                                                        His mother gave him the Indian tribal name of Wa-Tho-Huck, or Bright Path. Official records, however, list him as James Francis Thorpe.

                                                        Young Jim was sent to the Haskell Indian School at Lawrence, Kan., and then to the Carlisle School at Carlisle, Pa. He showed no particular interest in college athletics until Warner persuaded him to come out for football. That was in the fall of 1907
                                                        and he played as a substitute. The next year he became a regular and attracted attention as a ball-carrier and kicker. He weighed around 178 pounds.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Thorpe returned to his home and played baseball in North Carolina. In the fall of 1911 he came back to Carlisle. Warner thought he would have a better chance of making the Olympic team if he returned and persuaded him to do so. That year he won All-America
                                                        honors in football, as he did in 1912 also, performing sensationally against Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Army, Syracuse and Penn State. Against Harvard in 1911 Thorpe ran 70 yards in nine plays for
                                                        a touchdown and kicked three field goals from back of the 40-yard line.

                                                    <p>President Eisenhower can attest to Thorpe&apos;s hitting power. When the general was a cadet at the United States Military Academy, the Army team played Carlisle, the Indians winning, 27-6. Thorpe stopped
                                                        General Eisenhower time after time, and in the process the general injured his knee and never played again.</p>

He had confined his efforts to the jumps, the hurdles and the shot-put but now he undertook the pole vault, the javelin, discus, the hammer and the fifty-six-pound weight. In the Olympic trials
                                                        held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a claim to a place on the team that went to Sweden.

                                                        with other teams in Hammond, Ind., and Portsmouth, Ohio, and finally his competitive days ended.

                                                        Calif., and got work as an extra in motion pictures, appearing in Western serials and in short football features, but things got worse for him.</p>

                                                        A county fire rescue squad took over and was momentarily successful. Thorpe revived, recognized persons around him and spoke to them. He was conscious for only a brief time before he suffered a relapse and died.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>King Gustaf V of Sweden said to the black-haired Sac and Fox Indian as he stood before the royal box, &quot;Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.&quot; That was after Thorpe almost single-handedly
                                                        gained the Olympic honors for the United States, setting a point-total record never before approached and dominating the games as no other figure.</p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe came back from Stockholm with $50,000 worth of trophies. They included a Viking ship presented to him by the Czar of Russia, and gifts from King Gustaf.</p>
                                                    <p>A month later the new American sports idol was toppled from his high pedestal when the Amateur Athletic Union filed charges of professionalism against him, accusing him of receiving pay for playing summer
                                                        baseball with the Rocky Mount Club in the Eastern Carolina League. The amount of money was negligible, helping to tide him over at school, but the American Olympic Committee offered its apologies
                                                        and sent back the gifts and medals lavished upon the young man to whom President Theodore Roosevelt had cabled long messages of congratulation.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The medals were forwarded to the runners-up in the pentathlon and decathlon events at Stockholm. Thorpe had won four of the five events in the Pentathlon and finished third in the other, a record unequaled to this day, and in the decathlon he scored 8,412
                                                        out of a possible 10,000 points, also unequaled.

                                                        Nurmi--declared that &quot;Jim Thorpe could still beat them all.&quot;</p>

                                                    <p>Before leaping into world-wide fame as the star of the Olympics Thorpe had become a national sports figure through his deeds on the gridiron as a member of the famous Carlisle Indians football teams
                                                        coached by Glenn S. (Pop) Warner. In 1911 and 1912 he was chosen as halfback on Walter Camp&apos;s All-America teams. </p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe played professional football for almost fifteen years and in his prime at Carlisle and as a pro he never had to leave the field because of an injury, such was his courage and stamina. In his last

                                                        hockey, archery, rifle shooting, canoeing, handball, swimming and skating.</p>

                                                    <p>He could run the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat, the 220 in 21.8, the 440 in 50.8, the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35, the 120-yard high hurdles in 15 seconds and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24 seconds.
                                                        He broad-jumped 23 feet 6 inches and high-jumped 6 feet 5 inches. He pole-vaulted 11 feet, put the shot 47 feet 9 inches, threw the javelin 163 feet, the hammer 140 feet and the discus 136 feet.</p>
                                                    <p>Thorpe was born on a farm at Prague, Okla., the son of Hiram Thorpe, a ranchman. Dutch, Welsh and Irish blood were understood to flow in his veins, but he was predominantly Indian. As might have been
                                                        expected he learned to ride, swim and shoot almost as soon as he could walk, and he was punching cattle at the age of 10. His favorite diversion was following his hunting dogs in the forest, which
                                                        helped to develop his magnificent body.</p>

                                                        His mother gave him the Indian tribal name of Wa-Tho-Huck, or Bright Path. Official records, however, list him as James Francis Thorpe.

                                                        Young Jim was sent to the Haskell Indian School at Lawrence, Kan., and then to the Carlisle School at Carlisle, Pa. He showed no particular interest in college athletics until Warner persuaded him to come out for football. That was in the fall of 1907
                                                        and he played as a substitute. The next year he became a regular and attracted attention as a ball-carrier and kicker. He weighed around 178 pounds.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Thorpe returned to his home and played baseball in North Carolina. In the fall of 1911 he came back to Carlisle. Warner thought he would have a better chance of making the Olympic team if he returned and persuaded him to do so. That year he won All-America
                                                        honors in football, as he did in 1912 also, performing sensationally against Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Army, Syracuse and Penn State. Against Harvard in 1911 Thorpe ran 70 yards in nine plays for
                                                        a touchdown and kicked three field goals from back of the 40-yard line.

                                                    <p>President Eisenhower can attest to Thorpe&apos;s hitting power. When the general was a cadet at the United States Military Academy, the Army team played Carlisle, the Indians winning, 27-6. Thorpe stopped
                                                        General Eisenhower time after time, and in the process the general injured his knee and never played again.</p>

He had confined his efforts to the jumps, the hurdles and the shot-put but now he undertook the pole vault, the javelin, discus, the hammer and the fifty-six-pound weight. In the Olympic trials
                                                        held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a claim to a place on the team that went to Sweden.

                                                        with other teams in Hammond, Ind., and Portsmouth, Ohio, and finally his competitive days ended.

                                                        Calif., and got work as an extra in motion pictures, appearing in Western serials and in short football features, but things got worse for him.</p>
