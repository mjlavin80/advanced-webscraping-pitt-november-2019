                                                        He was 90 years old and had been suffering from a heart condition and high blood pressure for several years.

                                                        According to his longtime housekeeper, Fannie Corner, who was with him at the time of his death, Mr. Randolph died in bed at about 3 P.M. in the sparsely furnished fifth-floor apartment at 280 Ninth Avenue, at 27th Street, where he had lived for several
                                                        years.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The only signs of luxury in the apartment were two black-and-white television sets, a reflection, friends said, of Mr. Randolph&apos;s devotion to baseball.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>One of the first tributes came from Mr. Randolph&apos;s protege, Bayard Rustin.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Standing in Mr. Randolph&apos;s library, where plaques, diplomas and other honors were stacked against the wall, Mr. Rustin, who heads the A. Philip Randolph Institute, declared:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;No individual did more to help the poor, the dispossessed and the working class in the United States and around the world than A. Philip Randolph.

                                                    <p>&quot;With the exception of W. E. B. Du Bois, he was probably the greatest civil rights leader of this century until Martin Luther King.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Randolph had no known living relatives, according to Mr. Rustin, who said plans were being made for cremation to be followed by a memorial from 7 to 9 P.M. Saturday at the headquarters of the Recruitment and Training Program at 162 Fifth Avenue.

                                                        that propelled a new black leader onto the national scene.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was A. Philip Randolph who led the small, all-black International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to victory over the powerful corporation, and it turned out to be a significant gain not only for the railroad porters, maids and cooks of the union
                                                        but also for America&apos;s black community. And Mr. Carry&apos;s statement, made on Aug. 25, 1937, was a high point in Mr. Randolph&apos;s long career as a labor and civil rights leader.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph was a veteran of confrontations, a graduate of Harlem soapbox oratory who rose from a radical socialist and pacifist background to become a labor leader at a time when labor unions openly
                                                        espoused antiblack policies and a civil rights movement was virtually unheard of.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There were many who thought that in the twilight of his career, his body pained by illness, Mr. Randolph must have felt frustrated to see what little progress his long fight to change organized labor had produced. But he never publicly said so.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>And he must have smiled quietly to himself in later life as he was called conservative by some younger, more militant blacks who came on the scene with different tactics and beliefs--violence and separatism--that
                                                        he could not accept and who chastised him without knowing his radical past--that of a man who urged blacks not to fight in World War I, who criticized W. E. B. Du Bois for taking the opposite position
                                                        and whom President Woodrow Wilson called the most dangerous man in America.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Maintained Composure</b></p>
                                                    <p>But the tall, dignified Mr. Randolph always maintained his composure somehow, with no overt hostility to anyone.</p>
                                                    <p>His frustrations did cause him to make a fiery speech in San Francisco at the 1959 convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. On the podium later, an angry
                                                        George Meany turned to the calm Mr. Randolph and asked, &quot;Who the hell appointed you as guardian of all the Negroes in America?&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was his characteristic quiet dignity that enabled Mr. Randolph to lead confrontations with three Presidents, threatening massive marches on Washington and civil disobedience if those Presidents, who were all extremely popular among blacks, did not
                                                        take action on behalf of black people.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The first of those challenges came in 1941. Black leaders were seriously concerned about being barred from defense plants at the beginning of World War II. They had little success in moving the defense
                                                        industry or the Federal Government with speeches, conferences, meetings and verbal protests.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Eventually, Mr. Randolph felt that only President Franklin D. Roosevelt could force the necessary changes through an executive order and that only a massive march by blacks could make the President act.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>Date for March Set</b></p>
                                                    <p>Thus, a march on Washington was scheduled for July 1, 1941. The announcement horrified official Washington; the thought of thousands of blacks marching in what was still a Southern city caused near panic.
                                                        Mr. Roosevelt set about to prevent the march.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The President called on white labor leaders to try to talk Mr. Randolph and other black leaders out of marching. He enlisted Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York, a friend of Mr. Randolph. Even the President&apos;s wife, Eleanor, was asked to help.
                                                        But the effort did not work. The black leadership insisted on a meeting with the President himself.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Besides Mr. Randolph, the leaders of the planned march included Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Lester Granger of the National Urban League; Frank Crosswaith of the Negro Labor Committee; J. Finley Wilson
                                                        of the Improved Benevolent Order of Elks of the World, and the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of the Abyssinian Baptist Church of New York.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When the efforts of Mrs. Roosevelt and others failed to get the blacks to call off the march, President Roosevelt agreed to a meeting, which was held on June 18.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In that meeting, Mr. Randolph told Mr. Roosevelt that at least 100,000 blacks were expected to march. The President at first turned on his charm. He noticed Mr. Randolph&apos;s pronunciation of the broad &quot;a&quot; and inquired, &quot;Phil, when did
                                                        you graduate from Harvard?&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I never went to Harvard, Mr. President,&quot; Mr. Randolph answered.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>Executive Order Issued</b></p>
                                                    <p>When the President failed to dissuade the black leaders, he agreed to their demands. On June 25, 1941, six days before the march, he signed Executive Order 8802 and named a Fair Employment Practices
                                                        Committee to enforce it.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph called off the march but was denounced for doing so by his more militant followers in the coalition, who accused him of selling out. One of those objecting vigorously was Bayard Rustin,
                                                        later a faithful follower.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although the executive order was not observed uniformly, thousands of defense jobs were opened to blacks, and the order set a precedent that some state governments followed.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After the war, black leaders turned their attention to segregation in the armed forces, an issue that they had decided not to press in their confrontation with President Roosevelt. With the nation facing mandatory conscription in peacetime, Mr. Randolph
                                                        and the League for Nonviolent Civil Disobedience Against Military Segregation informed President Harry S. Truman that they wanted him to ban military segregation.

                                                    <p>
                                                        On March 22, 1948, the President met at the White House with black leaders, including Mr. Randolph, Mr. White, Mr. Granger, Mary McLeod Bethune, director of the National Council of Negro Women, and Charles Houston, N.A.A.C.P. legal counsel. The meeting
                                                        produced nothing.

                                                    <p>This sent Mr. Randolph on a civil disobedience campaign against the draft for segregated armed forces. He pursued his task with the same fervor as his opposition to World War I, when he had urged blacks
                                                        not to sign up for the draft.</p>

                                                        On July 26, 1948, President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, a vaguely worded document that never mentioned segregation but indeed banned it in the armed forces. Mr. Randolph called off his civil disobedience campaign, again prompting a bitter complaint
                                                        from Bayard Rustin and other radical pacifists.

                                                    <p>The final confrontation with a President was in 1963, when the ailing Mr. Randolph, who by then was more a symbol than an active participant in the fast-growing civil rights movement, helped organize
                                                        the biggest demonstration ever by blacks, the March on Washington. His aide, Mr. Rustin, was chief strategist for the coalition that sponsored the march of nearly a quarter-million people.

The main goal of the march was to push for passage of a civil rights bill. A bill was finally passed the next year, but not before the assassination
                                                        of President Kennedy and the almost evangelical commitment of President Lyndon B. Johnson.

                                                    <p>A. Philip Randolph was born on April 15, 1889, in Crescent City, Fla., a hamlet outside of Jacksonville. It was one of three communities his father served as minister of the African Methodist Episcopal
                                                        Church. Two years later the family moved to Jacksonville.</p>
                                                    <p>Philip and his older brother, James William Jr., grew up in a relatively intellectual atmosphere, exposed not only to Shakespeare, Scott and Dickens but also to such black heroes as L&apos;Ouverture,
                                                        Attucks, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner and Douglass. Both boys attended the Cookman Institute in Jacksonville, a Methodist missionary school.</p>
                                                    <p>After graduation in 1907, Philip Randolph worked at various jobs before heading to Harlem with a friend in 1911. He took a job as a hall porter at $4 a month and later recalled writing on a wall: &quot;Philip

The dynamic and witty Miss Green and the solemn Mr. Randolph were drawn to each other immediately--they called each other Buddy--and
                                                        in 1913 they were married.

                                                        In those years the South was wiping out all traces of Reconstruction, using violence, the white primary and the poll tax against blacks to complete their disenfranchisement. Poverty and ignorance ruled in back-country shanties and big-city slums, and
                                                        the number of lynchings and beatings of blacks increased yearly.

                                                    <p>President Wilson&apos;s Administration was reducing the number of Federal jobs allotted by custom to blacks, and was imposing segregation in government building in Washington. An extensive migration
                                                        began from the South. There was pervasive discrimination, and race riots were frequent in the North.</p>

                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph and Mr. Owen had founded a magazine, The Messenger, in 1915, with Mr. Randolph as editor. They lashed out at President Wilson. A gifted orator, Mr. Randolph also took his message to the
                                                        street, his resonant baritone booming from soapboxes from Harlem to black hamlets across the nation.</p>
                                                    <p>Once during the street-corner rallies, Mr. Randolph was arrested by the Justice Department on charges of treason for urging blacks not to fight in World War I. The charges were later dropped.</p>

                                                        The Pullman porters, listening from the crowds to the tall, forceful speaker, tapped him to organize the union. Since he was not an employee of the company, he could not be fired or harrassed.
                                                    </p>

                                                        The years that followed were made particularly arduous by the rocklike resistance of the Pullman Company and even the labor movement, which was then virtually all white.

                                                    <p>But in the signing of the first contract with Pullman in 1937, blacks made the first inroads into the trade union movement. The impact was especially important in the black community: It was greatly
                                                        encouraging that a small black union had broken the resistance of a corporate giant.

                                                        The Chief, as the porters called Mr. Randolph, had succeeded against overwhelming odds. In return they gave him unwavering loyalty.

                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph, along with Mr. Owen, had shaped The Messenger into an effective instrument of protest. After the porters were organized, the magazine was renamed Black Worker and centered on making the
                                                        union recognized in the labor movement and on ending discrimination.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph, in convention after convention of the American Federation of Labor, spoke out persistently against racial injustice--and futilely. White unionists seemed to think him a nuisance.</p>
                                                    <p>When one of his few white allies in the movement, John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers Union, walked out of the A.F.L. and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Mr. Randolph
                                                        went with him.</p>
                                                    <p>After the two labor organizations merged in 1955, Mr. Randolph became the only black representative on the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council. But in a further effort to end employment discrimination, he
                                                        formed the Negro American Labor Council in 1960. Two years later, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council censured him as being &quot;largely responsible&quot; for driving a wedge between blacks and
                                                        the unions.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph was undaunted. In an 80th birthday interview, he said:</p>

                                                        &quot;My philosophy was the result of our concept of effective liberation of the working people. We never separated the liberation of the white working man from the liberation of the black working man. . . . The unity of these forces would bring about
                                                        the power to rally to achieve basic social change.&quot;

                                                    <p>In the 1950&apos;s a new generation of black leaders organized a rising tide of demonstrations, North and South. At first they followed Mr. Randolph&apos;s precepts of pacifism and nonviolence, and he
                                                        frequently acted as a counselor on tactics and as a mediator of quarrels.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The next decade saw the growth of black militant nationalism. Young activists challenged the concept of nonviolence, as well as the integrationist ideals of such moderate leaders as Mr. Randolph.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He criticized the neo-black nationalist trend, as he had Marcus Garvey&apos;s &quot;back to Africa&quot; movement five decades before. Some nationalists branded him &quot;Uncle Tom,&quot; but he answered:

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;There must be a continuous quest for identification by the Negro, [but] I believe that can be overcome. And I believe the cult of blackness had been overdone. I wouldn&apos;t say it has been successful in putting these forces together.&quot;

                                                    <p>In 1963, Mr. Randolph announced the establishment of the A. Philip Randolph Institute with a grant of $25,000 from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and $30,000 from other sources. Under the leadership of Bayard Rustin,
                                                        the institute was given the task of enlisting community leaders in a broad study of conditions that create perpetual poverty.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1968, Mr. Randolph stepped down as president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and became its first president emeritus. By then the union, with the decline of rail travel, had only the memory of past glory. And as better jobs opened for blacks,
                                                        the Pullman porters lost the status they had once enjoyed in the black community. Eventually his union disappeared in a merger into the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks.

                                                        Also in 1968, Mr. Randolph moved from the Harlem apartment where he had lived so long to a downtown cooperative apartment owned by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. He busied himself writing an autobiography and a history of his own union,
                                                        although his health forced him to curtail his activities.

                                                    <p>In the last few years, Mr. Randolph lived very quietly in his Chelsea home, making very few public appearances.

                                                    <p>Over the years, a porter&apos;s union salary, which never exceeded $13,00 annually, had been his main support, with additional money earned from speeches and writings. In the early years, when the union
                                                        was struggling, he often had to rely on his wife&apos;s earnings.</p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Randolph died in 1963, shortly before the March on Washington, with Mr. Randolph in the lead column. He had wanted her to see it. For others, the memory of that event, on Aug. 28, 1963, became one
                                                        of Mr. Randolph&apos;s greatest legacies.

                                                        As news of Mr. Randolph&apos;s death spread through the civil rights community, tributes began pouring in from many who had drawn inspiration from the man who began to stir the conscience of the nation more than half a century ago.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>One of the first tributes came from Mr. Randolph&apos;s protege, Bayard Rustin.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Standing in Mr. Randolph&apos;s library, where plaques, diplomas and other honors were stacked against the wall, Mr. Rustin, who heads the A. Philip Randolph Institute, declared:

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;No individual did more to help the poor, the dispossessed and the working class in the United States and around the world than A. Philip Randolph.

                                                    <p>&quot;With the exception of W. E. B. Du Bois, he was probably the greatest civil rights leader of this century until Martin Luther King.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Randolph had no known living relatives, according to Mr. Rustin, who said plans were being made for cremation to be followed by a memorial from 7 to 9 P.M. Saturday at the headquarters of the Recruitment and Training Program at 162 Fifth Avenue.

                                                        that propelled a new black leader onto the national scene.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was A. Philip Randolph who led the small, all-black International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to victory over the powerful corporation, and it turned out to be a significant gain not only for the railroad porters, maids and cooks of the union
                                                        but also for America&apos;s black community. And Mr. Carry&apos;s statement, made on Aug. 25, 1937, was a high point in Mr. Randolph&apos;s long career as a labor and civil rights leader.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph was a veteran of confrontations, a graduate of Harlem soapbox oratory who rose from a radical socialist and pacifist background to become a labor leader at a time when labor unions openly
                                                        espoused antiblack policies and a civil rights movement was virtually unheard of.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There were many who thought that in the twilight of his career, his body pained by illness, Mr. Randolph must have felt frustrated to see what little progress his long fight to change organized labor had produced. But he never publicly said so.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>And he must have smiled quietly to himself in later life as he was called conservative by some younger, more militant blacks who came on the scene with different tactics and beliefs--violence and separatism--that
                                                        he could not accept and who chastised him without knowing his radical past--that of a man who urged blacks not to fight in World War I, who criticized W. E. B. Du Bois for taking the opposite position
                                                        and whom President Woodrow Wilson called the most dangerous man in America.</p>
                                                    <p><b>Maintained Composure</b></p>
                                                    <p>But the tall, dignified Mr. Randolph always maintained his composure somehow, with no overt hostility to anyone.</p>
                                                    <p>His frustrations did cause him to make a fiery speech in San Francisco at the 1959 convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. On the podium later, an angry
                                                        George Meany turned to the calm Mr. Randolph and asked, &quot;Who the hell appointed you as guardian of all the Negroes in America?&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was his characteristic quiet dignity that enabled Mr. Randolph to lead confrontations with three Presidents, threatening massive marches on Washington and civil disobedience if those Presidents, who were all extremely popular among blacks, did not
                                                        take action on behalf of black people.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The first of those challenges came in 1941. Black leaders were seriously concerned about being barred from defense plants at the beginning of World War II. They had little success in moving the defense
                                                        industry or the Federal Government with speeches, conferences, meetings and verbal protests.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Eventually, Mr. Randolph felt that only President Franklin D. Roosevelt could force the necessary changes through an executive order and that only a massive march by blacks could make the President act.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>Date for March Set</b></p>
                                                    <p>Thus, a march on Washington was scheduled for July 1, 1941. The announcement horrified official Washington; the thought of thousands of blacks marching in what was still a Southern city caused near panic.
                                                        Mr. Roosevelt set about to prevent the march.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The President called on white labor leaders to try to talk Mr. Randolph and other black leaders out of marching. He enlisted Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York, a friend of Mr. Randolph. Even the President&apos;s wife, Eleanor, was asked to help.
                                                        But the effort did not work. The black leadership insisted on a meeting with the President himself.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Besides Mr. Randolph, the leaders of the planned march included Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Lester Granger of the National Urban League; Frank Crosswaith of the Negro Labor Committee; J. Finley Wilson
                                                        of the Improved Benevolent Order of Elks of the World, and the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of the Abyssinian Baptist Church of New York.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When the efforts of Mrs. Roosevelt and others failed to get the blacks to call off the march, President Roosevelt agreed to a meeting, which was held on June 18.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In that meeting, Mr. Randolph told Mr. Roosevelt that at least 100,000 blacks were expected to march. The President at first turned on his charm. He noticed Mr. Randolph&apos;s pronunciation of the broad &quot;a&quot; and inquired, &quot;Phil, when did
                                                        you graduate from Harvard?&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I never went to Harvard, Mr. President,&quot; Mr. Randolph answered.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>Executive Order Issued</b></p>
                                                    <p>When the President failed to dissuade the black leaders, he agreed to their demands. On June 25, 1941, six days before the march, he signed Executive Order 8802 and named a Fair Employment Practices
                                                        Committee to enforce it.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph called off the march but was denounced for doing so by his more militant followers in the coalition, who accused him of selling out. One of those objecting vigorously was Bayard Rustin,
                                                        later a faithful follower.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although the executive order was not observed uniformly, thousands of defense jobs were opened to blacks, and the order set a precedent that some state governments followed.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After the war, black leaders turned their attention to segregation in the armed forces, an issue that they had decided not to press in their confrontation with President Roosevelt. With the nation facing mandatory conscription in peacetime, Mr. Randolph
                                                        and the League for Nonviolent Civil Disobedience Against Military Segregation informed President Harry S. Truman that they wanted him to ban military segregation.

                                                        On March 22, 1948, the President met at the White House with black leaders, including Mr. Randolph, Mr. White, Mr. Granger, Mary McLeod Bethune, director of the National Council of Negro Women, and Charles Houston, N.A.A.C.P. legal counsel. The meeting
                                                        produced nothing.

                                                    <p>This sent Mr. Randolph on a civil disobedience campaign against the draft for segregated armed forces. He pursued his task with the same fervor as his opposition to World War I, when he had urged blacks
                                                        not to sign up for the draft.</p>

Mr. Randolph called off his civil disobedience campaign, again prompting a bitter complaint
                                                        from Bayard Rustin and other radical pacifists.

                                                    <p>The final confrontation with a President was in 1963, when the ailing Mr. Randolph, who by then was more a symbol than an active participant in the fast-growing civil rights movement, helped organize
                                                        the biggest demonstration ever by blacks, the March on Washington. His aide, Mr. Rustin, was chief strategist for the coalition that sponsored the march of nearly a quarter-million people.

The main goal of the march was to push for passage of a civil rights bill. A bill was finally passed the next year, but not before the assassination
                                                        of President Kennedy and the almost evangelical commitment of President Lyndon B. Johnson.

                                                    <p>A. Philip Randolph was born on April 15, 1889, in Crescent City, Fla., a hamlet outside of Jacksonville. It was one of three communities his father served as minister of the African Methodist Episcopal
                                                        Church. Two years later the family moved to Jacksonville.</p>
                                                    <p>Philip and his older brother, James William Jr., grew up in a relatively intellectual atmosphere, exposed not only to Shakespeare, Scott and Dickens but also to such black heroes as L&apos;Ouverture,
                                                        Attucks, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner and Douglass. Both boys attended the Cookman Institute in Jacksonville, a Methodist missionary school.</p>
                                                    <p>After graduation in 1907, Philip Randolph worked at various jobs before heading to Harlem with a friend in 1911. He took a job as a hall porter at $4 a month and later recalled writing on a wall: &quot;Philip

The dynamic and witty Miss Green and the solemn Mr. Randolph were drawn to each other immediately--they called each other Buddy--and
                                                        in 1913 they were married.

                                                        In those years the South was wiping out all traces of Reconstruction, using violence, the white primary and the poll tax against blacks to complete their disenfranchisement. Poverty and ignorance ruled in back-country shanties and big-city slums, and
                                                        the number of lynchings and beatings of blacks increased yearly.

                                                    <p>President Wilson&apos;s Administration was reducing the number of Federal jobs allotted by custom to blacks, and was imposing segregation in government building in Washington. An extensive migration
                                                        began from the South. There was pervasive discrimination, and race riots were frequent in the North.</p>

                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph and Mr. Owen had founded a magazine, The Messenger, in 1915, with Mr. Randolph as editor. They lashed out at President Wilson. A gifted orator, Mr. Randolph also took his message to the
                                                        street, his resonant baritone booming from soapboxes from Harlem to black hamlets across the nation.</p>
                                                    <p>Once during the street-corner rallies, Mr. Randolph was arrested by the Justice Department on charges of treason for urging blacks not to fight in World War I. The charges were later dropped.</p>

                                                        The years that followed were made particularly arduous by the rocklike resistance of the Pullman Company and even the labor movement, which was then virtually all white.

                                                    <p>But in the signing of the first contract with Pullman in 1937, blacks made the first inroads into the trade union movement. The impact was especially important in the black community: It was greatly
                                                        encouraging that a small black union had broken the resistance of a corporate giant.

                                                        union recognized in the labor movement and on ending discrimination.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph, in convention after convention of the American Federation of Labor, spoke out persistently against racial injustice--and futilely. White unionists seemed to think him a nuisance.</p>
                                                    <p>When one of his few white allies in the movement, John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers Union, walked out of the A.F.L. and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Mr. Randolph
                                                        went with him.</p>

                                                        formed the Negro American Labor Council in 1960. Two years later, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council censured him as being &quot;largely responsible&quot; for driving a wedge between blacks and
                                                        the unions.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Randolph was undaunted. In an 80th birthday interview, he said:</p>

                                                        &quot;My philosophy was the result of our concept of effective liberation of the working people. We never separated the liberation of the white working man from the liberation of the black working man. . . . The unity of these forces would bring about
                                                        the power to rally to achieve basic social change.&quot;

                                                    <p>In the 1950&apos;s a new generation of black leaders organized a rising tide of demonstrations, North and South. At first they followed Mr. Randolph&apos;s precepts of pacifism and nonviolence, and he
                                                        frequently acted as a counselor on tactics and as a mediator of quarrels.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The next decade saw the growth of black militant nationalism. Young activists challenged the concept of nonviolence, as well as the integrationist ideals of such moderate leaders as Mr. Randolph.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He criticized the neo-black nationalist trend, as he had Marcus Garvey&apos;s &quot;back to Africa&quot; movement five decades before. Some nationalists branded him &quot;Uncle Tom,&quot; but he answered:

                                                        &quot;There must be a continuous quest for identification by the Negro, [but] I believe that can be overcome. And I believe the cult of blackness had been overdone. I wouldn&apos;t say it has been successful in putting these forces together.&quot;

                                                    <p>In 1963, Mr. Randolph announced the establishment of the A. Philip Randolph Institute with a grant of $25,000 from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and $30,000 from other sources. Under the leadership of Bayard Rustin,
                                                        the institute was given the task of enlisting community leaders in a broad study of conditions that create perpetual poverty.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1968, Mr. Randolph stepped down as president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and became its first president emeritus. By then the union, with the decline of rail travel, had only the memory of past glory. And as better jobs opened for blacks,
                                                        the Pullman porters lost the status they had once enjoyed in the black community. Eventually his union disappeared in a merger into the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks.

                                                        Also in 1968, Mr. Randolph moved from the Harlem apartment where he had lived so long to a downtown cooperative apartment owned by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. He busied himself writing an autobiography and a history of his own union,
                                                        although his health forced him to curtail his activities.

                                                    <p>Over the years, a porter&apos;s union salary, which never exceeded $13,00 annually, had been his main support, with additional money earned from speeches and writings. In the early years, when the union
                                                        was struggling, he often had to rely on his wife&apos;s earnings.</p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Randolph died in 1963, shortly before the March on Washington, with Mr. Randolph in the lead column. He had wanted her to see it. For others, the memory of that event, on Aug. 28, 1963, became one
                                                        of Mr. Randolph&apos;s greatest legacies.
