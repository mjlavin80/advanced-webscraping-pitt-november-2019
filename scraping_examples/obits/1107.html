                                        PARIS, July 4.--Mme. Marie Curie, whose work alone and with her husband on radium and radiology has been one of the greatest glories of modern science, died at 6 o&apos;clock this morning in a sanitarium near Sallanches in Upper Savoy. Her death, which
                                        was caused by a form of pernicious anemia, was hastened by what her physicians termed &quot;a long accumulation of radiations&quot; which affected the bones and prevented her from reacting normally to the disease.
                                        </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Mme. Curie went to Sallanches last Friday after having been for five weeks in a Paris clinic. It was thought at first that she had suffered a lung ailment and for that reason she was sent to the mountains. Her death came as a surprise to all but her family
                                        and intimate friends, for the rare modesty of her character never deserted her and she did not allow the public to know how ill she was. Her daughters, Eve, who is a dramatist and pianist of considerable talent,
                                        and Mme. Jolliot, who with her husband was carrying on the family tradition at the radium institute over which her mother presided, were at the bedside when the end came. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The funeral Thursday will be strictly private in accordance with Mme. Curie&apos;s expressed wishes. However, it is possible that the government will, on the occasion of her burial in Paris Cemetery beside her husband, take advantage of the opportunity
                                        to pay France&apos;s homage to her adopted daughter. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Few persons contributed more to the general welfare of mankind and to the advancement of science than the modest, self-effacing woman whom the world knew as Mme. Curie. Her epoch-making discoveries of polonium and radium, the subsequent honors that were
                                        bestowed upon her--she was the only person to receive two Nobel prizes--and the fortunes that could have been hers had she wanted them did not change her mode of life. She remained a worker in the cause of science,
                                        preferring her laboratory to a great social place in the sun. The road which she and her husband had chosen she followed throughout her life, disdaining all pomp. And thus she not only conquered great secrets of
                                        science but the hearts of the people the world over. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Mme. Curie was one of many illustrious persons who came from Poland to settle elsewhere, such as Frederic Chopin, the Potockis and Joseph Conrad. Her father was a distinguished scientist and from him she received her early training in Warsaw. She became
                                        involved in the students&apos; revolutionary organization, however, and found it advisable to leave the country. Years later she returned to open the radioactivity laboratory in Warsaw; she had always had the longing
                                        of the nostalgic for her native land, and she gave the $50,000 which she had received from American admirers in 1929 for research work in the city of her birth. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Earnestness of purpose and total disregard of personal gain were two of her main characteristics. She summed up her biography in twenty-one words when interviewed some years ago. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        &quot;I was born in Poland,&quot; she said. &quot;I married Pierre Curie, and I have two daughters. I have done my work in France.&quot; </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Mme. Curie was engrossed in her research work. Her other great interest in life was her little family. The tragic death of her husband--he was run over and killed by a heavy dray in Paris on April 19, 1906--served to make her even more of a recluse from
                                        the world. Their marriage had been happy and they had shared the honor and glory of discovering radium after years of patient research work. </p>

                                        broken and patched glass roof, hot in Summer, heated by a cast-iron stove in Winter, they performed their wonderful work. </p>

She was laboratory chief assistant and handy boy at the same time. In addition to her intellectual labor it was frequently
                                        necessary for her to perform severe manual toil. On many an afternoon she stirred in a great caldron with a heavy iron rod the molten mass of the radioactive products, reaching home at evening exhausted by fatigue

                                        The announcement came from that little ill-equipped laboratory on Dec. 26, 1898. The Curies informed the Academy of Sciences that they had discovered a new and remarkable substance to which they proposed to give the name of radium. </p>

                                        Today there stands in Paris the Curie Laboratory at the Radium Institute of the University of Paris. Today the many uses of radium are known. Thousands have been cured of cancer and other diseases by radium. Five years after their discovery of radium
                                        the Curies received the Nobel Prize for physics, dividing it with Becquerel. In 1911 Mme. Curie received the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Honors were heaped upon her, but she was indifferent to most. The money she
                                        received from her prizes was immediately used for purposes of scientific research. In 1919 one gram of radium, valued at $100,000, was presented to Mme. Curie as the gift of the people of the United States. In 1929
                                        she received the money with which to purchase another gram of the precious substance, the presentation being made by President Hoover. </p>

                                        Mme. Curie continued her frugal and active life, residing with her two daughters and shunning notoriety of any form. Already as a child she had been extremely studious, and was the chief assistant of her father, Dr. Ladislas Sklodowski, scientist and
                                        teacher at the Lycee of Warsaw. Her mother, Bronsitawa Boguska, was principal of a girls&apos; school. </p>

                                        Marie Sklodowska was born on Nov. 7, 1867. As a child she played with test tubes and crucibles and she was later a brilliant student. When she became involved in political differences she went first to Cracow, then under Austrian rule, and later to Paris,
                                        where she obtained a science degree at the university. </p>

                                        At the Sorbonne she met Pierre Curie, a young physics instructor. They worked together, having common interests, and in 1895 they were married. Mme. Curie became a teacher of physics at a girls&apos; school at Sevres. The research work was pursued at

                                        The discovery of X-rays by Dr. Roentgen in 1895 started many physicists and chemists on investigations to see whether phosphorescent bodies in general would not emit rays of a similar character. In 1896 Becquerel found that the salts of uranium emitted
                                        radiations affecting photographic plates and, like the X-ray, passing through many substances impervious to ordinary light. </p>

                                        Later Mme. Curie discovered that the salts of thorium emitted similar rays. Searching for other radio-active material, M. and Mme. Curie, after long and tedious, but to them fascinating, trials, discovered that pitchblende was much more active than uranium.
                                        Mme. Curie made up her mind to go still further. She would not stop short of finding out what it was in pitchblende that produced the radio-active force that would pass through any substance except lead and steel.

                                        But at that time pitchblende was to be had only from a small deposit in Bohemia. Mme. Curie reduced tons of it and then, first by chemical separation and then by eliminations, she finally isolated two fiercely energetic substances. One she called polonium
                                        after her native country, the other radium. </p>

                                        &quot;Mme. Curie,&quot; he said on that occasion, &quot;proved in 1898 that of many of the chemical substances, those which contained uranium or thorium alone were capable of emitting in notable quantities Becquerel rays. * * * Mme. Curie studied the
                                        minerals which had in them uranium or thorium, and found these minerals were radio-active. In her experiments she found that some of them were more active than they would have been if they had contained only uranium
                                        or thorium. Mme. Curie then made the hypothesis that these substances contained radio-active chemicals as yet unknown. Mme. Curie executed these experimental works and reached her momentous conclusion alone.&quot;

                                        Several years passed, however, before the general public knew of radium. A watch-case containing a speck of the rare element was exhibited a the Paris Exposition in 1900. It was labeled, &quot;Radium, discovered by Mme. Curie.&quot; In 1901 the French
                                        Academy of Sciences awarded the La Caze Prize of 10,000 francs to the Curies. </p>

                                        Soon afterward Mme. Curie put chemistry in possession of a relatively large quantity of radium, as she had by a crystallization process obtained a decigram of the pure chlorid, which allowed her to obtain the atomic weight. </p>

                                        in aiding the wounded. At her suggestion, automobiles equipped with radiographic apparatus were utilized along the front, and by this means bullets and shell splinters were located in the heads of dangerously wounded
