                                                        Elmer A. Sperry, inventor, died yesterday morning at St. John&apos;s Hospital, Brooklyn, from complications which set in after he had recovered from an operation for gallstones six weeks ago. He was in his seventieth year.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Funeral services will be held at 10:30 o&apos;clock Thursday morning at the Plymouth Church, Orange Street, Brooklyn. The Rev. S. Parkes Cadman will officiate. Burial will follow in Greenwood Cemetery. The names of the honorary pallbearers will be announced
                                                        later.

                                                        More than fifty years of Mr. Sperry&apos;s life had been devoted to invention. At his death, he was said to have taken out nearly 400 patents, about double the number taken out by Edison.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He is best known for his utilization of the gyroscope for the stabilization of ships, airplanes and aerial torpedoes. Only about two months ago a giant army bombing plane, equipped with two Sperry gyroscopes serving as automatic pilots, flew from Sacramento
                                                        to San Francisco without the guidance of human hands.

                                                        He also invented the gyro compass, which eliminated the variations due to the earth&apos;s magnetism. Next he invented &quot; metal mike,&quot; the automatic steersman, which keeps a ship on a set course. Next he used it to stabilize ships and to keep
                                                        them on an even keel in all kinds of weather. Later, he applied the gyroscope to airplanes, with devices to give fliers artificial horizons, enabling them to fly &quot;blind&quot; in dense fogs.

                                                        Elmer Ambrose Sperry was born in Cortland, N.Y., Oct. 12, 1860, son of Stephen Decatur and Mary (Borst) Sperry, and a descendant of Richard Sperry, who, in 1666, secreted and maintained in the Judges Cave at New Haven Colony three of the judges who had
                                                        condemned Charles I to death. He was educated in the State Normal School in Cortland and then attended Cornell University for one term, from 1879 to 1880.

As a member of the naval consulting board since 1915, Mr. Sperry has rendered invaluable
                                                        service as chairman of the committees on mines and torpedoes and aids to navigation and as a committee member on aeronautics, internal combustion engines, and special problems. His numerous inventions,
                                                        including his gyrocompass, plane stabilizer, high intensity searchlight and his many refinements on apparatus for accurately controlling the fire of our guns, have assisted materially in placing
                                                        the navy in first-class fighting trim. It is safe to say that no one American has contributed so much to our naval technical progress.&quot;
