                                                        Boston, Nov. 27--Eugene O&apos;Neill, noted American playwright whose prolific talents had brought to him both Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, died today of bronchial pneumonia. His age was 65.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The announcement of the death was made by Dr. Harry L. Kozol of Boston. Mr. O&apos;Neill had been ill for several years with Parkinson&apos;s disease, a form of palsy that made writing virtually impossible.
                                                    </p>

                                                        The writer had been in and out of various hospitals in eastern Massachusetts in recent years, but had sought to keep the visits unpublicized.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Mr. O&apos;Neill died in a Boston apartment where he had been living recently. His third wife, Carlotta Monterey, and Dr. Kozol were at the bedside.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He also leaves a daughter, Oona O&apos;Neill, who resides with her husband, Charles Chaplain, the actor, in Lucerne, Switzerland, and London. The funeral will be private.

                                                        Eugene Gladstone O&apos;Neill was generally regarded as the foremost American playwright, his achievements in the theatre overwhelming those of his ablest contemporaries. Whatever judgment posterity may make, the history of the stage will have to find
                                                        an important niche for him, for he came upon the scene at an opportune moment and remained active long after the American theatre had come of age.

                                                        In the words of Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, Mr. O&apos;Neill broke a number of old molds, shook up the drama as well as audiences and helped to transform the theatre into an art seriously related to life. The genius of Mr. O&apos;Neill lay
                                                        in raw boldness, in the elemental strength of his attack upon outworn concepts of destiny.

His plays continued to be produced to acclaim here and abroad and the fall of 1951 saw a real O&apos;Neill &quot;revival&quot; on Broadway. The American National Theatre and
                                                        Academy scheduled his &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; to launch its new season and the Craftsmen, a small dramatic group, produced the same play at the Barbizon-Plaza Theatre. In addition, the
                                                        New York City Theatre Company played &quot;Anna Christie&quot; as the second offering of its winter season.

Out of these experiences came such plays as &quot;The Hairy Ape,&quot; &quot;Anna Christie&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Horizon,&quot; all of which
                                                        have had a lasting life in the theatre.

His father was the James O&apos;Neill who starred for so many years in &quot;The Count of Monte

In 1902, when he was 13, he entered Betts Academy in Stamford, Conn., considered at the time one of

                                                        bound for Buenos Aires. This began his acquaintance with the forecastle that was to stand him in good dramatic stead later on.

                                                        he was more interested in writing verse, swimming and sunbathing than in gathering news.

He spent five months there and was to say later that it was while at the sanitarium that his mind got a chance to
                                                        &quot;establish itself, to digest and to evaluate the impressions of many past years in which one experience had crowded on another with never a second&apos;s reflection.&quot;

                                                        analyses of human emotions. The play ran for 289 performances.

At times, even, he was the object of bitter denunciation, especially from persons who believed his works smacked of immorality. By his choice of themes he several times stirred up storms that swept his

                                                        Many critics felt that &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra,&quot; which opened on Oct. 26, 1931, and had fourteen acts, was Mr. O&apos;Neill&apos;s greatest masterpiece. Mr. Atkinson called it &quot;heroically thought out and magnificently wrought in style
                                                        and structure.&quot; John Mason Brown said that it was &quot;an achievement which restores the theatre to its highest state&quot; and Joseph Wood Krutch observed that &quot;it may turn out to be
                                                        the only permanent contribution yet made by the twentieth century to dramatic literature.&quot;

The venture never came off. In 1936, he won the

He refused to talk about it but he had shown the manuscript to
                                                        a few friends, and it was reported that the play deals with his own family life.

The disease caused his hands to jerk convulsively, making it impossible for him to write in longhand. He tried to compose a play by dictation but discovered he could not
