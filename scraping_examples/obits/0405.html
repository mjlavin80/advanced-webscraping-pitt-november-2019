                                                        TUSKEGEE, Ala., Nov. 14.--Booker T. Washington, foremost teacher and leader of the negro race, died early today at his home here, near the Tuskegee Institute, which he founded and of which he was President. Hardening of the arteries, following a nervous
                                                        breakdown, caused his death four hours after Dr. Washington arrived from New York.

                                                        Although he had been in failing health for several months, the negro leader&apos;s condition became serious only last week while he was in the East. He then realized the end was near, but was determined to make the last long trip South. He said often:
                                                        &quot;I was born in the South, have lived all my life in the South, and expect to die and be buried in the South.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Accompanied by his wife, his secretary, and a physician, Dr. Washington left New York for Tuskegee at 4 o&apos;clock on Friday afternoon. He reached home last midnight, and died at 4:40 o&apos;clock this morning. His last public appearance was at the
                                                        national conference of Congregational churches in New York, where he delivered a lecture on Oct. 25. The funeral will be held at Tuskegee Institute on Wednesday morning at 10 o&apos;clock.

                                                        No one knows the day, nor even with certainty the year, of the birth of Booker T. Washington; but the day of his death was announced by telegraph and cable to many parts of the world.

                                                        He began life as &quot;just another little nigger&quot; on a plantation of a family named Burrows in Hale&apos;s Ford, Va. The month and year of his birth were probably April, 1858, although Dr. Washington himself was not sure of this. In the biographical
                                                        paragraph under his name in &quot;Who&apos;s Who in America,&quot; it is said that he was born &quot;about 1859.&quot; The only certain fact is that he was born into slavery when negro mothers made
                                                        no record of nor long remembered the date of a child&apos;s birth.

                                                        Soon after the close of the civil war the little negro boy went with his stepmother to Malden, West Va., where he worked in salt furnaces for nine moths in the year and attended school for three months. After several years of such life the boy obtained
                                                        work in the kitchen of Mrs. Viola Ruffner, a New England woman who had married a Southerner. Mrs. Ruffner soon recognized the boy&apos;s eagerness and ability to advance himself, so she taught him
                                                        the elementary subjects. Booker Washington felt grateful to her to the end of his life, because she really gave him his start.

                                                        He heard of the Hampton Institute, for negroes, in 1871, when he was about thirteen years old, and he decided at once to attend it. So, with the little money he had been able to save from his wages of $6 a week, he set out for Richmond, Va., hoping to
                                                        earn enough there to enable him to go on to Hampton, which is near Norfolk. This was in 1871. Dr. Washington founded the Tuskeegee Institute just ten years later. He was admitted to the institute
                                                        and was graduated at the head of his class in 1875, after working his way through the school.

                                                        After graduation Dr. Washington returned to Malden and taught school until he had earned enough to enable him to go to the Wayland Seminary in Washington, D. C., where he studied until 1879, when he was called to Hampton as a teacher in the institute.
                                                        After he had taught for two years, in 1881 the State of Alabama voted to found an industrial institute for negroes similar to that at Hampton, and, after searching for a negro qualified to head the
                                                        proposed institution, Dr. Washington was selected. This was his entrance into the &quot;black belt&quot; of the South, a chance which he had long desired, and when he assumed charge of the institute
                                                        at Tuskegee, Ala., his real life&apos;s work began.

                                                        The State had appropriated $2,000 a year, and it was the task of the negro to organize the school. How well he did this is shown by a comparison of statistics. The institute opened on July 4, 1881, with one teacher and thirty pupils. At that time it had
                                                        neither land nor buildings, nothing but the $2,000 a year granted by the Alabama Legislature.

This did
                                                        not include 22,000 acres of public land remaining unsold from the 25,000 acres granted by Congress, valued at $135,000, nor the endowment fund, which was $1,275,644. During the year there were more
                                                        than 1,500 students enrolled in the school, more than 1,000 young men, and more than 500 young women. The students were trained in thirty-seven industries.

                                                        It was on the opening day of the Atlanta Exposition in 1895 that Dr. Washington became a national character. On that day he delivered an address that was heard by thousands and read by other thousands in far-away places with wonder that a man so wise
                                                        and clear- seeing should arise from among his people to lead them upward. For it was because Dr. Washington stood out as a negro striving in a sensible and sincere way to help negroes that he commanded
                                                        attention on that day in Atlanta.

When elected to organize the Tuskegee Institute, he traveled through the &quot;black belt&quot; in order to become acquainted with the people whom
                                                        he was to teach.

I found them living on fat pork and corn bread, and yet not infrequently I discovered in
                                                        these cabins sewing machines which no one knew how to use, which had cost as much as $60, or showy clocks which had cost as much as $10 or $12, but which never told the time. I remember a cabin where
                                                        there was but one fork on the table for the use of five members of the family and myself, while in the opposite corner was an organ for which the family was paying $60 in monthly installments. The
                                                        truth that forced itself upon me was that these people needed not only book learning, but knowledge of how to live; they needed to know how to cultivate the soil, to husband their resources, and
                                                        make the most of their opportunities.&quot;

Men of Affairs Come to His Aid</b></p>

                                                        Word of his aims, advertised to the world in the Atlanta speech, spread all over the country, and soon men and women of means began to want to assist Dr. Washington. Chief among these was Andrew Carnegie, who began by giving a $20,000 library to the institute,
                                                        which he followed with a regular contribution of $10,000 a year. The climax of Mr. Carnegie&apos;s generosity toward the institute was reached in 1903, when he gave $600,000 to the endowment fund.

Though he never seemed to seek them, honors of
                                                        all kinds were bestowed upon the negro. The degree of M. A. was conferred upon him by Harvard in 1896, and LL. D. by Dartmouth in 1901. In 1910, when Dr. Washington was in Europe, he was received
                                                        by the King of Denmark, addressed the National Liberal Club in London, and visited Mr. Carnegie in Skibo Castle.

Mr. Ogden became interested in negro educational work through his association with General Samuel Chapman Armstrong,
                                                        the founder of the Hampton Institute, and as the President of the Southern Educational Board he did much to overcome southern prejudice against the education of negroes and spread the knowledge of
                                                        Hampton and Tuskegee among both the white and black people.

Dr. Washington went to the White House at the invitation of the
                                                        President, and, when the news was spread abroad, thousands, both North and South, who were moved by race prejudice or by a belief that social equality between blacks and whites had been encouraged,
                                                        became angry. Most of the criticism fell upon Colonel Roosevelt, but the incident served also to injure Dr. Washington&apos;s work in some parts of the South.

The month and year of his birth were probably April, 1858, although Dr. Washington himself was not sure of this. In the biographical

                                                        Soon after the close of the civil war the little negro boy went with his stepmother to Malden, West Va., where he worked in salt furnaces for nine moths in the year and attended school for three months. After several years of such life the boy obtained
                                                        work in the kitchen of Mrs. Viola Ruffner, a New England woman who had married a Southerner. Mrs. Ruffner soon recognized the boy&apos;s eagerness and ability to advance himself, so she taught him
                                                        the elementary subjects. Booker Washington felt grateful to her to the end of his life, because she really gave him his start.

So, with the little money he had been able to save from his wages of $6 a week, he set out for Richmond, Va., hoping to
                                                        earn enough there to enable him to go on to Hampton, which is near Norfolk. This was in 1871. Dr. Washington founded the Tuskeegee Institute just ten years later. He was admitted to the institute
                                                        and was graduated at the head of his class in 1875, after working his way through the school.

C., where he studied until 1879, when he was called to Hampton as a teacher in the institute.
                                                        After he had taught for two years, in 1881 the State of Alabama voted to found an industrial institute for negroes similar to that at Hampton, and, after searching for a negro qualified to head the
                                                        proposed institution, Dr. Washington was selected. This was his entrance into the &quot;black belt&quot; of the South, a chance which he had long desired, and when he assumed charge of the institute
                                                        at Tuskegee, Ala., his real life&apos;s work began.

How well he did this is shown by a comparison of statistics. The institute opened on July 4, 1881, with one teacher and thirty pupils. At that time it had
                                                        neither land nor buildings, nothing but the $2,000 a year granted by the Alabama Legislature.

This did
                                                        not include 22,000 acres of public land remaining unsold from the 25,000 acres granted by Congress, valued at $135,000, nor the endowment fund, which was $1,275,644. During the year there were more
                                                        than 1,500 students enrolled in the school, more than 1,000 young men, and more than 500 young women. The students were trained in thirty-seven industries.

On that day he delivered an address that was heard by thousands and read by other thousands in far-away places with wonder that a man so wise

When elected to organize the Tuskegee Institute, he traveled through the &quot;black belt&quot; in order to become acquainted with the people whom

                                                        these cabins sewing machines which no one knew how to use, which had cost as much as $60, or showy clocks which had cost as much as $10 or $12, but which never told the time. I remember a cabin where
                                                        there was but one fork on the table for the use of five members of the family and myself, while in the opposite corner was an organ for which the family was paying $60 in monthly installments. The
                                                        truth that forced itself upon me was that these people needed not only book learning, but knowledge of how to live; they needed to know how to cultivate the soil, to husband their resources, and
                                                        make the most of their opportunities.&quot;

Chief among these was Andrew Carnegie, who began by giving a $20,000 library to the institute,

                                                        all kinds were bestowed upon the negro. The degree of M. A. was conferred upon him by Harvard in 1896, and LL. D. by Dartmouth in 1901. In 1910, when Dr. Washington was in Europe, he was received
                                                        by the King of Denmark, addressed the National Liberal Club in London, and visited Mr. Carnegie in Skibo Castle.
