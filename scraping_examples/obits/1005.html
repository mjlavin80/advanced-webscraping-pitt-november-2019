He carefully chose the recipients of his McDonald&apos;s franchises, seeking managers who were skilled at personal relations; he relentlessly stressed

He was in his 50&apos;s when he went into the hamburger business, making himself president of the McDonald&apos;s Corporation
                                                        in 1955. In 1968 he became chairman, and he took the title of senior chairman in 1977, when McDonald&apos;s purveyed more than $3.7 billion worth of fast-food fare, outselling its archcompetitor,
                                                        the Pillsbury-owned Burger King, by 4 to 1.

They reached a peak in January 1973 of around 77; investors who bought them when first offered in the mid-1960&apos;s had seen their wealth multiply

The authors Max Boas and Steve Chain charged in a 1976 book, &quot;Big Mac: The Unauthorized Story of McDonald&apos;s,&quot; that McDonald&apos;s had exploited its employees by forcing them
                                                        to take lie- detector tests and by appropriating their tips. The architecture of McDonald&apos;s outlets was sometimes criticized, as was the nutritional content of the food. But one critic, the
                                                        nutritionist Jean Mayer, once said, &quot;I am nonfanatical about McDonald&apos;s; as a weekend treat, it is clean and fast.&quot;

                                                        on the question of teen-age wage limits, a matter of prime importance to McDonald&apos;s.

The bulky rings on his fingers glinted as he ate his hamburgers with both hands.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Under Mr. Kroc&apos;s persistent goading, McDonald&apos;s insisted that franchise owners run their own outlets. It also poured hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising--to the point where the head of another fast-food company said in 1978 that
                                                        consumers were &quot;so preconditioned by McDonald&apos;s advertising blanket that the hamburger would taste good even if they left the meat out.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Kroc was also unremittingly intense in training his franchise owners at &quot;Hamburger University&quot; in Elk Grove, Ill., where a training course led to a &quot;Bachelor of Hamburgerology with a minor in french fries.&quot; Instructors told new
                                                        McDonald&apos;s owners how to clean grills, how to flip a hamburger and how to tell when one was done. &quot;It starts turning brown around the edge.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Kroc met his wife, Joan, in a restaurant in 1956 when he and she had other spouses. They were married in 1968, and she went on to found and become the head of Operation Cork, a national program to help the families of alcoholics. It started in 1976,
                                                        financed by McDonald&apos;s revenues through the Kroc Foundation. Operation Cork&apos;s activities included an $800,000 grant to the Dartmouth Medical School to frame a model curriculum for the study
                                                        of alcohol misuse and alcoholism.

                                                        Mr. Kroc suffered a stroke in December 1979 and soon afterward entered an alcoholism treatment center in Orange, Calif., because, he said at the time, &quot;I am required to take medication which is incompatible with the use of alcohol.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        Mr. Kroc&apos;s survivors include his wife, Joan, of La Jolla; a brother, Dr. Robert Kroc of Santa Ynez, Calif.; a sister, Lorraine Groh of Lafayette, Ind.; a stepdaughter, Mrs. Linda Smith of San Diego, and four granddaughters. A memorial service is
                                                        planned for Friday in Oak Brook.
