                                                    <h5>By FRANK J. PRIAL</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Jacques Monod, the Nobel Prize-winning French biologist and director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, died yesterday at his home in Cannes, France. He was 66 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. Monod shared the 1965 Nobel award for medicine and physiology with two colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, Francois Jacob and Andre Lwoff, for research on the workings of the living cell.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was probably best known for his book-length essay, &quot;Chance and Necessity,&quot; published in 1970. In it he postulated his chilling conviction that all existence is because of chance and that mankind&apos;s inevitable recognition of this fact
                                                        will necessitate a complete revolution in human thought.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Chance alone is at the source of all novelty, all creation in the biosphere,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Pure chance, only chance, absolute but blind liberty is at the root of the prodigious edifice that is evolution. . . .&quot;
                                                    </p>

A dapper, urbane man who played the cello and loved to sail, Jacques Lucien Monod was also a hero of the French Resistance. He held both

He studied at the Cannes Lycee and the University of Paris and joined the Pasteur Institute as a zoology instructor in 1931. He

He was a Rockefeller Foundation fellow in 1936, and was named a nonresident

                                                        He was a frequent and open critic of the French Government for what he saw as its parsimonious treatment of scientific research, particularly of research at the Pasteur Institute. Just after winning the Nobel Prize in 1965, Professor Monod disclosed that

                                                        In 1973, Dr. Monod visited this country, in an attempt to save the Pasteur Institute from bankruptcy. He noted he had trimmed the staff, patented a new influenza vaccine in the name of the institute, and had appealed for both governmental and private
                                                        support.

                                                        The institute was founded by Louis Pasteur in 1888 with public donations including large grants from the Czar of Russia, the Sultan of Turkey and the Emperor of Brazil. Pasteur was buried there in 1895. Eight men who worked or studied there have won Nobel
                                                        Prizes in medicine or physiology.

After taking over in 1971, Dr. Monod dismissed more than 130 scientists and technicians, or about 10 percent
                                                        of the staff.

Control of Protein Manufacture</b></p>

                                                        They found that while one type of gene in a cell&apos;s nucleus holds the blueprints for the substances to the manufactured, another gene regulates the rate of production, based on whether a given protein is in long or short supply. This is the mechanism
                                                        that permits the required coordination of all the molecular manufacturing activities that are the essence of the metabolism and thus of life itself.

                                                    <h5>By FRANK J. PRIAL</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Jacques Monod, the Nobel Prize-winning French biologist and director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, died yesterday at his home in Cannes, France. He was 66 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. Monod shared the 1965 Nobel award for medicine and physiology with two colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, Francois Jacob and Andre Lwoff, for research on the workings of the living cell.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was probably best known for his book-length essay, &quot;Chance and Necessity,&quot; published in 1970. In it he postulated his chilling conviction that all existence is because of chance and that mankind&apos;s inevitable recognition of this fact
                                                        will necessitate a complete revolution in human thought.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Chance alone is at the source of all novelty, all creation in the biosphere,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Pure chance, only chance, absolute but blind liberty is at the root of the prodigious edifice that is evolution. . . .&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although he flirted briefly with Communism during World War II, he was as harsh on Marxist dialecticians as on what he called the &quot;disgusting farrago of Judeo-Christian religiosity.&quot;
                                                    </p>

He studied at the Cannes Lycee and the University of Paris and joined the Pasteur Institute as a zoology instructor in 1931. He

Just after winning the Nobel Prize in 1965, Professor Monod disclosed that

                                                        In 1973, Dr. Monod visited this country, in an attempt to save the Pasteur Institute from bankruptcy. He noted he had trimmed the staff, patented a new influenza vaccine in the name of the institute, and had appealed for both governmental and private
                                                        support.

                                                        The institute was founded by Louis Pasteur in 1888 with public donations including large grants from the Czar of Russia, the Sultan of Turkey and the Emperor of Brazil. Pasteur was buried there in 1895. Eight men who worked or studied there have won Nobel
                                                        Prizes in medicine or physiology.

After taking over in 1971, Dr. Monod dismissed more than 130 scientists and technicians, or about 10 percent
                                                        of the staff.

Control of Protein Manufacture</b></p>

                                                        They found that while one type of gene in a cell&apos;s nucleus holds the blueprints for the substances to the manufactured, another gene regulates the rate of production, based on whether a given protein is in long or short supply. This is the mechanism
                                                        that permits the required coordination of all the molecular manufacturing activities that are the essence of the metabolism and thus of life itself.
