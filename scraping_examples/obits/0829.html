                                                    <h5>By MURRAY SCHUMACH</h5>
                                                    <p>Ingrid Bergman, the three-time Academy Award-winning actress who exemplified wholesome beauty and nobility to countless moviegoers, died of cancer Sunday at her home in London on her 67th birthday.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Bergman had been ill for eight years. Despite this, she played two of her most demanding roles in this period, a concert pianist in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s &apos;&apos;Autumn Sonata&apos;&apos; and Golda Meir, the Israeli Prime Minister in &apos;&apos;A
                                                        Woman Called Golda.&apos;&apos; her last role.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Bergman said in an interview earlier this year that she was determined not to let her illness prevent her from enjoying the remainder of her life.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &apos;&apos;Cancer victims who don&apos;t accept their fate, who don&apos;t learn to live with it, will only destroy what little time they have left,&apos;&apos; she said. Miss Bergman added that she had to push herself to play the role of Golda Meir:
                                                        &apos;&apos;I honestly didn&apos;t think I had it in me. But it has been a wonderful experience, as an actress and as a human being who is getting more out of life than expected.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>

                                                        Lars Schmidt, a Swedish producer from whom Miss Bergman was divorced in 1975, was with her at the time of her death. Incandescent, the critics called Ingrid Bergman. Or radiant. Or luminous. They said her performances were sincere, natural. Sometimes
                                                        a single adjective was not enough. One enraptured writer saw her as &apos;&apos;a breeze whipping over a Scandinavian peak.&apos;&apos; Kenneth Tynan needed an essay before he distilled her quality
                                                        down to a sort of electric transmission of &apos;&apos;I need you&apos;&apos; that registered instantly upon yearning audiences.

The expressive blue eyes, wide, fulllipped mouth, high cheekbones, soft chin and broad forehead projected a quality that combined vulnerability and courage;
                                                        sensitivity and earthiness, and an unending flow of compassion.

                                                        that won her three Academy Awards.

She did not indulge in tantrums or engage in harangues with directors. If she had a question about a script, she asked it without fuss. She could be counted on to be letter perfect
                                                        in her lines before she faced the camera. And during the intervals between scenes, her relaxing smile and hearty laugh were as unaffected as her low-heeled shoes, long walking stride and minimal
                                                        makeup.

                                                        roles. In a sense, she became a barometer of changing moral values in the United States.

But she spent nearly all of her remaining

                                                        censorship, she considered nudity, particularly in love scenes, ugly, saying: &apos;&apos;Since the beginning of time, good theater has existed without nudity. Why change now?&apos;&apos;</p>

                                                        Miss Bergman was born in Stockholm on Aug. 29, 1915. Her mother, who was from Hamburg, Germany, died when Ingrid was three years old. As an only child, she learned to create imaginary friends. Her father, who had a camera shop, adored her and photographed
                                                        her constantly, often in costume. He died when she was 13. She lived briefly with an unmarried aunt and then with an uncle and aunt who had five children.

                                                        At 17, although she was tall and somewhat ungainly - she was 5 feet 9 inches and weighed about 135 pounds - she auditioned successfully for the government-sponsored Royal Dramatic School.

                                                        Within seven years she was one of the leading movie stars in Sweden and had refused several offers from Hollywood. Finally, in 1939, at the age of 24, Miss Bergman agreed to do a film for David O. Selznick. It was &apos;&apos;Intermezzo,&apos;&apos; with
                                                        Leslie Howard. She returned to Sweden to her husband, who was then a dentist, and their daughter, Pia.

                                                        The film was so successful that Mr. Selznick, convinced he had found &apos;&apos;another Garbo,&apos;&apos; persuaded her to return to Hollywood. Looking back on her career many years later, particularly on her feeling of youthful shyness and awkwardness,
                                                        the actress said: &apos;&apos;I can do everything with ease on the stage, whereas in real life I feel too big and clumsy. So I didn&apos;t choose acting. It chose me.&apos;&apos; Miss Bergman is
                                                        survived by her four children, who were reported to be flying to London yesterday for the funeral. The funeral will be &apos;&apos;a very quiet, family affair,&apos;&apos; said Alfred Jackman, funeral
