She sought to create equality between the sexes by freeing women from what she saw as sexual servitude.

In 1937, a year after the Comstock law was reinterpreted to provide for distribution of contraceptive information, the American Medical Association adopted a report
                                                        that recognized birth control as part of legitimate medical practice.

On Nov. 14, 1921, when Mrs. Sanger arrived at Town Hall on West 43d Street
                                                        to take part in the discussion, &quot;Birth Control: Is It Moral?&quot; she found the police closing the meeting.

A disorderly conduct charge against her was dismissed the next day. The New York Times account of the interrupted meeting stated that the police
                                                        intervention was &quot;brought about at the instance of Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes of this Roman Catholic Archdiocese.&quot;

In contrast to police action at many

                                                        a contraceptive device sent to her by a physician in Japan. Subsequent interpretations of his decision greatly broadened the scope of the circulation of birth control devices and artificial birth

Her disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church led her to say in 1960 that if Senator John F. Kennedy was elected President she would
                                                        leave the United States. She opposed Mr. Kennedy because of his religion.
