                                                    <p>
                                                        ATLANTA, Aug. 16--Margaret Mitchell, author of &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; died today at Grady Hospital of injuries received when she was struck down by a speeding automobile on Peachtree Street last Thursday.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Not once since the accident had the 49-year-old Miss Mitchell fully regained consciousness, according to hospital attaches. At infrequent intervals, she had murmured vague, incoherent responses to spoken questions.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Shortly after Miss Mitchell died, the driver of the auto which struck her surrendered voluntarily to police and Atlanta Police Chief Herbert Jenkins said an &quot;immediate murder indictment&quot; would be sought. Hugh D. Gravitt, 29, the driver, had
                                                        been out on bond of $5,450, after having been arrested at the scene of the accident and charged with drunken driving, speeding and driving on the wrong side of the street.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Gravitt, an Atlanta taxi driver, was off duty and driving a private car when Miss Mitchell was struck as she and her husband, John R. Marsh, were crossing Peachtree at Thirteenth Street on the way to a neighborhood movie. Mr. Marsh was the &quot;J.R.M.&quot;
                                                        to whom &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was dedicated.

The publication, the next June, of her 1,037-page novel of the South in reconstruction
                                                        days, &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; made her an international personage.

She said one day, in a fit of exasperation as she left for a mountain
                                                        hideaway from the throngs which besieged her by telephone, telegraph and in person, that she had determined never to write another word as long as she lived.

She was almost lost in the confusion which greeted the
                                                        premiere of the movie of her book in Atlanta on Dec. 15, 1939.

In addition, I am giving all the time I can to war activities and future commitments
                                                        in this field which will take me out of the city.&quot;</p>

                                                        novel.
