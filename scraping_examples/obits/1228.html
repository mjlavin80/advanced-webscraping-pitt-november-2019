                                                    <h5>By JON PARELES</h5>
                                                    <p>Earl (Fatha) Hines, the father of modern jazz piano, died Friday in Oakland, Calif., after a heart attack. He was 77 years old. In his pioneering work with Louis Armstrong in the late 1920&apos;s, Mr.
                                                        Hines virtually redefined jazz piano. With what he called &apos;&apos;trumpet style,&apos;&apos; Mr. Hines played horn-like solo lines in octaves with his right hand and spurred them with chords
                                                        from his left. He thus carved a place for the piano as a solo instrument outside the rhythm section and defined the roles of both hands for the next generations of jazz pianists.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Hines&apos;s strong right hand and angular melodic ideas continued to sound contemporary throughout his career. In the 1930&apos;s and 1940&apos;s, he led a Chicago big band that began the careers of the singers Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughan and
                                                        included the saxophonists Wardell Gray and Budd Johnson. That band became an incubator for be-bop in the early 1940&apos;s, when it featured the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the saxophonist Charlie
                                                        Parker.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>Son of Two Musicians</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Earl Hines was born in Duquesne, Pa. His father was a trumpeter and his mother played piano and organ. He took up the trumpet as a child, but began studying classical piano at the age of 9. After three years of lessons, he decided he was more interested
                                                        in jazz piano, and by the time he was 15 years old he was leading his own trio.

After dissolving his band, Mr. Hines worked with smaller groups. He rejoined Mr.

                                                        jazz - music that he had not be Jack Teagarden, but he spent much of the 1950&apos;s playing Dixieland jazz - music that he had not been a part of - on the West Coast.
