                                                    <p>ROCHESTER, March 13, -- Miss Susan B. Anthony died at 12:40 o&apos;clock this morning. The end came peacefully. Miss Anthony had been unconscious practically all of the time for more than twenty-four
                                                        hours, and her death had been almost momentarily expected since last night. Only her wonderful constitution kept her alive.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. M. S. Ricker, her attending physician, said Miss Anthony died of heart disease and pneumonia of both lungs. She had had serious valvular heart trouble for the last six or seven years. Her lungs were practically clear and the pneumonia had yielded
                                                        to treatment, but the weakness of her heart prevented her recovery.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony was taken ill while on her way home from the National Suffrage Convention in Baltimore. She stopped in New York, where a banquet was to be given Feb. 20 in honor of her eighty-sixth birthday, but she had an attack of neuralgia on Feb. 18
                                                        and hastened home. Pneumonia developed after her arrival here, and on March 5 both her lungs became affected. She rallied, but had a relapse three days ago, and the end after that never was in doubt.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony herself had believed that she would recover. Early in her illness she told her friends that she expected to live to be as old as her father, who was over 90 when he died. But on Wednesday she said to her sister:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Write to Anna Shaw immediately, and tell her I desire that every cent I leave when I pass out of this life shall be given to the fund which Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett are raising for the cause. I have given my life and all I am to it, and now
                                                        I want my last act to be to give it all I have, to the last cent. Tell Anna Shaw to see that this is done.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Shaw said:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;On Sunday, about two hours before she became unconscious, I talked with Miss Anthony, and she said: &apos;To think I have had more than sixty years of hard struggle for a little liberty, and then to die without it seems so cruel.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Susan Brownell Anthony was a pioneer leader of the cause of woman suffrage, and her energy was tireless in working for what she considered to be the best interests of womankind. At home and abroad she had innumerable friends, not only among those who
                                                        sympathized with her views, but among those who held opinions radically opposed to her. In recent years her age made it impossible for her to continue active participation in all the movements for
                                                        the enfranchisement of women with which she had been connected, but she was at the time of her death the Honorary President of the National Woman Suffrage Association, the society which she and Elizabeth
                                                        Cady Stanton organized in 1869.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony possessed a figure of medium size, a firm but rather pleasing face, clear hazel eyes, and dark hair which she always wore combed smoothly over the ears and bound in a coil at the back. She paid much attention to dress and advised those associated
                                                        in the movement for women suffrage to be punctilious in all matters pertaining to the toilet. For a little over a year in the early fifties she wore a bloomer costume, consisting of a short skirt
                                                        and a pair of Turkish trousers gathered at the ankles. So great an outcry arose against the innovation both from the pulpit and the press that she was subjected to many indignities, and forced to
                                                        abandon it.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony was born at South Adams, Mass., on Feb. 15, 1820. Daniel Anthony, her father, a liberal Quaker, was a cotton manufacturer. Susan Anthony was first instructed by teachers at home. She was sent afterward to finish her education at a Friends&apos;
                                                        boarding school in Philadelphia. She continued to attend this school until, at the age of fifteen, she was occasionally called on to help in the teaching. At seventeen she received a dollar a week
                                                        with board by teaching in a private family, and the next summer a district school engaged her for $1.50 a week and &quot;boarded her round.&quot; She continued to teach until 1852, when she found
                                                        her taste for this profession entirely gone, a school in Rochester being her last charge.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony had become impressed with the idea that women were suffering great wrongs, and when she abandoned school teaching, having saved only about $300, she determined to enter the lecture field. People of to-day can scarcely understand the strong
                                                        prejudices Miss Anthony had to live down. In 1851 she called a temperance convention in Albany, admittance to a previous convention having been refused to her because it was not the custom to admit
                                                        women. The Women&apos;s New York State Temperance Society was organized the following year. Through Miss Anthony&apos;s exertions and those of Elizabeth Cady Stanton women soon came to be admitted
                                                        to educational and other conventions, with the right to speak, vote, and act upon committees.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony&apos;s active participation in the movement for woman suffrage started in the fifties. As early as 1854 she arranged conventions throughout the State and annually bombarded the Legislature with messages and appeals. She was active in obtaining
                                                        the passage of the act of the New York Legislature in 1860 giving to married women the possession of their earnings and the guardianship of their children. During the war she was devoted to the Women&apos;s
                                                        Loyal League, which petitioned Congress in favor of the thirteenth amendment. She was also directly interested in the fourteenth amendment, sending a petition in favor of leaving out the word &quot;male.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In company with Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone, Miss Anthony went to Kansas in 1867, and there obtained 9,000 votes in favor of woman suffrage. The following year, with the co-operation of Mrs. Stanton, Parker Pillsbury, and George Francis Train, she began
                                                        the publication in this city of a weekly paper called The Revolutionist, devoted to the emancipation of women.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In order to test the application of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments she cast ballots in the State and Congressional election in Rochester in 1872. She was indicted and ordered to pay a fine, but the order was never enforced.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony succeeded Mrs. Stanton as President of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1892, Mrs. Stanton having resigned because of old age. This office she held until February, 1899, her farewell address being delivered at a meeting of the association
                                                        in Washington. For a number of years she averaged 100 lectures a year. She engaged in eight different State campaigns for a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women, and hearings before committees
                                                        of practically every Congress since 1869 were granted to her.

                                                    <p>She was the joint author with Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, and Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage of &quot;The History of Woman Suffrage.&quot; She also was a frequent contributor to magazines.</p>

                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>ROCHESTER, March 13, -- Miss Susan B. Anthony died at 12:40 o&apos;clock this morning. The end came peacefully. Miss Anthony had been unconscious practically all of the time for more than twenty-four
                                                        hours, and her death had been almost momentarily expected since last night. Only her wonderful constitution kept her alive.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. M. S. Ricker, her attending physician, said Miss Anthony died of heart disease and pneumonia of both lungs. She had had serious valvular heart trouble for the last six or seven years. Her lungs were practically clear and the pneumonia had yielded
                                                        to treatment, but the weakness of her heart prevented her recovery.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony was taken ill while on her way home from the National Suffrage Convention in Baltimore. She stopped in New York, where a banquet was to be given Feb. 20 in honor of her eighty-sixth birthday, but she had an attack of neuralgia on Feb. 18
                                                        and hastened home. Pneumonia developed after her arrival here, and on March 5 both her lungs became affected. She rallied, but had a relapse three days ago, and the end after that never was in doubt.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony herself had believed that she would recover. Early in her illness she told her friends that she expected to live to be as old as her father, who was over 90 when he died. But on Wednesday she said to her sister:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Write to Anna Shaw immediately, and tell her I desire that every cent I leave when I pass out of this life shall be given to the fund which Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett are raising for the cause. I have given my life and all I am to it, and now
                                                        I want my last act to be to give it all I have, to the last cent. Tell Anna Shaw to see that this is done.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Shaw said:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;On Sunday, about two hours before she became unconscious, I talked with Miss Anthony, and she said: &apos;To think I have had more than sixty years of hard struggle for a little liberty, and then to die without it seems so cruel.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Susan Brownell Anthony was a pioneer leader of the cause of woman suffrage, and her energy was tireless in working for what she considered to be the best interests of womankind. At home and abroad she had innumerable friends, not only among those who
                                                        sympathized with her views, but among those who held opinions radically opposed to her. In recent years her age made it impossible for her to continue active participation in all the movements for
                                                        the enfranchisement of women with which she had been connected, but she was at the time of her death the Honorary President of the National Woman Suffrage Association, the society which she and Elizabeth
                                                        Cady Stanton organized in 1869.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony possessed a figure of medium size, a firm but rather pleasing face, clear hazel eyes, and dark hair which she always wore combed smoothly over the ears and bound in a coil at the back. She paid much attention to dress and advised those associated
                                                        in the movement for women suffrage to be punctilious in all matters pertaining to the toilet. For a little over a year in the early fifties she wore a bloomer costume, consisting of a short skirt
                                                        and a pair of Turkish trousers gathered at the ankles. So great an outcry arose against the innovation both from the pulpit and the press that she was subjected to many indignities, and forced to
                                                        abandon it.

                                                        Miss Anthony was born at South Adams, Mass., on Feb. 15, 1820. Daniel Anthony, her father, a liberal Quaker, was a cotton manufacturer. Susan Anthony was first instructed by teachers at home. She was sent afterward to finish her education at a Friends&apos;
                                                        boarding school in Philadelphia. She continued to attend this school until, at the age of fifteen, she was occasionally called on to help in the teaching. At seventeen she received a dollar a week
                                                        with board by teaching in a private family, and the next summer a district school engaged her for $1.50 a week and &quot;boarded her round.&quot; She continued to teach until 1852, when she found
                                                        her taste for this profession entirely gone, a school in Rochester being her last charge.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Anthony had become impressed with the idea that women were suffering great wrongs, and when she abandoned school teaching, having saved only about $300, she determined to enter the lecture field. People of to-day can scarcely understand the strong
                                                        prejudices Miss Anthony had to live down. In 1851 she called a temperance convention in Albany, admittance to a previous convention having been refused to her because it was not the custom to admit
                                                        women. The Women&apos;s New York State Temperance Society was organized the following year. Through Miss Anthony&apos;s exertions and those of Elizabeth Cady Stanton women soon came to be admitted
                                                        to educational and other conventions, with the right to speak, vote, and act upon committees.

                                                        Miss Anthony&apos;s active participation in the movement for woman suffrage started in the fifties. As early as 1854 she arranged conventions throughout the State and annually bombarded the Legislature with messages and appeals. She was active in obtaining
                                                        the passage of the act of the New York Legislature in 1860 giving to married women the possession of their earnings and the guardianship of their children. During the war she was devoted to the Women&apos;s
                                                        Loyal League, which petitioned Congress in favor of the thirteenth amendment. She was also directly interested in the fourteenth amendment, sending a petition in favor of leaving out the word &quot;male.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        In company with Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone, Miss Anthony went to Kansas in 1867, and there obtained 9,000 votes in favor of woman suffrage. The following year, with the co-operation of Mrs. Stanton, Parker Pillsbury, and George Francis Train, she began
                                                        the publication in this city of a weekly paper called The Revolutionist, devoted to the emancipation of women.

                                                        In order to test the application of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments she cast ballots in the State and Congressional election in Rochester in 1872. She was indicted and ordered to pay a fine, but the order was never enforced.

                                                        Miss Anthony succeeded Mrs. Stanton as President of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1892, Mrs. Stanton having resigned because of old age. This office she held until February, 1899, her farewell address being delivered at a meeting of the association
                                                        in Washington. For a number of years she averaged 100 lectures a year. She engaged in eight different State campaigns for a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women, and hearings before committees
                                                        of practically every Congress since 1869 were granted to her.
