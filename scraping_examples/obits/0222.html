                                                        Edna St. Vincent Millay was a terse and moving spokesman during the Twenties, the Thirties and the Forties. She was an idol of the younger generation during the glorious early days of Greenwich Village when she wrote, what critics termed a frivolous but
                                                        widely know poem which ended:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        My candle burns at both ends, It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends, It gives a lovely light!
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        All critics agreed, however, that Greenwich Village and Vassar, plus a gypsy childhood on the rocky coast of Maine, produced one of the greatest American poets of her time. In 1940 she published in THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine a plea against isolationism
                                                        which said, &quot;There are no islands any more,&quot; and during the second World War she wrote of the Nazi massacre of the Czechoslovak city of Lidice:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The whole world holds in its arms today The murdered village of Lidice, Like the murdered body of a little child, Innocent, happy, surprised at play.

                                                        Before this, when Miss Millay won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1922, her work had become more profound and less personal as she grew out of the &quot;flaming youth&quot; era in the Village. The nation and the world had become her concern.

                                                        Miss Millay was born in Rockland, Me., on Feb. 22, 1892, in an old house &quot;between the mountains and the sea&quot; where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods.

                                                        She was the eldest of three sisters, brought up by their mother, the former Cora Buzelle. Of the younger sisters, Norma became an actress and Kathleen a writer, whose first novel, published in 1927, was succeeded by fairy stories, short stories, plays
                                                        and verse.

                                                        Floyd Dell, novelist and unofficial historian of the Village in the early Twenties, has written how the mother worked to bring up her daughters in &quot;gay and courageous poverty.&quot;

                                                        Edna, the tomboy of the family, was usually called &quot;Vincent&quot; by her mother and sisters. Her talent was recognized and encouraged and poetry was read and reread in the household. At 14 she won the St. Nicholas Gold Badge for poetry, the first
                                                        of many honors. In the poem that gave its name to her volume, &quot;The Harp-Weaver,&quot; some have discovered the inspiration of her poor youth and her mother&apos;s devotion.

                                                        Edna entered Vassar late. She was then 21 years old, but when she was 18 she had finished the first part of her first long poem, &quot;Renascence,&quot; and at 20 had ended it. It was published in a prize contest, which incidentally, it did not win. Sonnets
                                                        and lyrics followed while she still was in college. She was graduated in 1917 and came to live in the Village, remaining for years, something of a tradition in her college.

                                                        Miss Millay, says Floyd Dell, was in those days &quot;a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a mouth like a valentine,&quot; young, red-haired and unquestionably pretty. But the Village was the wartime Village, and Miss
                                                        Millay took the radical stand.

Inez Milholland, feminist leader, to whom the sonnet &quot;The Pioneer&quot; is a tribute, was one of her admirers. In a play, &quot;Aria da Capo,&quot; written in 1921, she expressed
                                                        her hatred of war, and it has been recorded that she haunted court rooms with her pacifist friends, reciting to them her poetry to comfort them while juries decided on their cases.

She acted without pay with the Provincetown Players in their converted stable on Macdougal Street and got a part in a Theatre Guild production. For some
                                                        time she did hack writing for magazines under a pseudonym.

There followed &quot;Second April&quot; in 1921 and &quot;The Lamp and the Bell&quot;
                                                        and a morality play, &quot;Two Slatterns and a King,&quot; in the same year, and in 1922, with the Pulitzer Prize, her position as a poet was established.

For her plot she went to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of Eadgar, King of
                                                        Wessex, a story not unlike that of Tristan and Isolde, and the result was &quot;The King&apos;s Henchman,&quot; called by one writer the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever

                                                        Edna St. Vincent Millay was a terse and moving spokesman during the Twenties, the Thirties and the Forties. She was an idol of the younger generation during the glorious early days of Greenwich Village when she wrote, what critics termed a frivolous but
                                                        widely know poem which ended:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        My candle burns at both ends, It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends, It gives a lovely light!

                                                        All critics agreed, however, that Greenwich Village and Vassar, plus a gypsy childhood on the rocky coast of Maine, produced one of the greatest American poets of her time. In 1940 she published in THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine a plea against isolationism
                                                        which said, &quot;There are no islands any more,&quot; and during the second World War she wrote of the Nazi massacre of the Czechoslovak city of Lidice:

                                                        Miss Millay was born in Rockland, Me., on Feb. 22, 1892, in an old house &quot;between the mountains and the sea&quot; where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods.

                                                        She was the eldest of three sisters, brought up by their mother, the former Cora Buzelle. Of the younger sisters, Norma became an actress and Kathleen a writer, whose first novel, published in 1927, was succeeded by fairy stories, short stories, plays
                                                        and verse.

Her talent was recognized and encouraged and poetry was read and reread in the household. At 14 she won the St. Nicholas Gold Badge for poetry, the first
                                                        of many honors. In the poem that gave its name to her volume, &quot;The Harp-Weaver,&quot; some have discovered the inspiration of her poor youth and her mother&apos;s devotion.

                                                        Edna entered Vassar late. She was then 21 years old, but when she was 18 she had finished the first part of her first long poem, &quot;Renascence,&quot; and at 20 had ended it. It was published in a prize contest, which incidentally, it did not win. Sonnets
                                                        and lyrics followed while she still was in college. She was graduated in 1917 and came to live in the Village, remaining for years, something of a tradition in her college.

But the Village was the wartime Village, and Miss
                                                        Millay took the radical stand.

Inez Milholland, feminist leader, to whom the sonnet &quot;The Pioneer&quot; is a tribute, was one of her admirers. In a play, &quot;Aria da Capo,&quot; written in 1921, she expressed
                                                        her hatred of war, and it has been recorded that she haunted court rooms with her pacifist friends, reciting to them her poetry to comfort them while juries decided on their cases.

For her plot she went to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of Eadgar, King of
                                                        Wessex, a story not unlike that of Tristan and Isolde, and the result was &quot;The King&apos;s Henchman,&quot; called by one writer the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever
