                                                    <h5>By ALBIN KREBS</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Truman Capote, one of the postwar era&apos;s leading American writers, whose prose shimmered with clarity and quality, died yesterday in Los Angeles at the age of 59.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Capote died at the home of Joanna Carson, former wife of the entertainer Johnny Carson, in the Bel-Air section, according to Comdr. William Booth of the Los Angeles Police Department. &apos;&apos;There
                                                        is no indication of foul play,&apos;&apos; he said, adding that the county coroner&apos;s office would investigate the cause of death. </p>
                                                    <p> The novelist, short story writer and literary celebrity pioneered a genre he called &apos;&apos;the nonfiction novel,&apos;&apos; exemplified by his immensely popular &apos;&apos;In Cold Blood.&apos;&apos;
                                                        He died apparently without having completed his long- promised &apos;&apos;masterwork,&apos;&apos; an extensive novel called &apos;&apos;Answered Prayers.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Capote&apos;s first story was published while he was still in his teens, but his work totaled only 13 volumes, most of them slim collections, and in the view of many of his critics, notably his old
                                                        friend John Malcolm Brinnin, he failed to join the ranks of the truly great American writers because he squandered his time, talent and health on the pursuit of celebrity, riches and pleasure.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;I had to be successful, and I had to be successful early,&apos;&apos; Mr. Capote said in 1978. &apos;&apos;The thing about people like me is that we always knew what we were going to do.
                                                        Many people spend half their lives not knowing. But I was a very special person, and I had to have a very special life. I was not meant to work in an office or something, though I would have been

                                                        I realized I just might have found a solution to what had always been my greatest creative quandary. I wanted to produce a journalistic novel, something on a large scale that would have the credibility
                                                        of fact, the immediacy of film, the depth and freedom of prose, and the precision of poetry.&apos;&apos;</p>
                                                    <b> Praise for &apos;In Cold Blood&apos; </b>
                                                    <p> The result of Mr. Capote&apos;s discovery was &apos;&apos;In Cold Blood,&apos;&apos; which was almost universally praised. John Hersey called it &apos;&apos;a remarkable book,&apos;&apos; for example,
                                                        but there were dissenters. Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, sniped at &apos;&apos;In Cold Blood,&apos;&apos; saying &apos;&apos;this isn&apos;t writing, it&apos;s research&apos;&apos; - a
                                                        sly borrowing from Mr. Capote&apos;s witty thumbnail critique, years earlier, of the rambling books of the late Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac: &apos;&apos;This isn&apos;t writing, it&apos;s
                                                        typing.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The critic Kenneth Tynan took Mr. Capote to task for being too strictly a reporter and not making an effort to have the killers&apos; lives spared.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Many readers were struck by Mr. Capote&apos;s verbatim quotations of long, involved conversations and incidents in his book. He explained that this came from &apos;&apos;a talent for mentally recording
                                                        lengthy conversations, an ability I had worked to achieve while researching &apos;The Muses Are Heard,&apos; for I devoutly believe that the taking of notes, much less the use of a tape recorder,
                                                        creates artifice and distorts or even destroys any naturalness that might exist between the observer and the observed, the nervous hummingbird and its would-be captor.&apos;&apos; He said his trick
                                                        was to rush away from an interview and immmediately write down everything he had been told.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Capote was co-author of the movie &apos;&apos;Beat the Devil&apos;&apos; with John Huston and wrote the screenplay for a film of Henry James&apos;s &apos;&apos;The Innocents.&apos;&apos; Mr. Capote
                                                        turned his second novel, &apos;&apos;The Grass Harp,&apos;&apos; into an unsuccessful Broadway play and, with Harold Arlen, wrote the 1954 musical, also unsuccessful, &apos;&apos;House of Flowers.&apos;&apos;
                                                        Mr. Capote also adapted a number of his stories, including &apos;&apos;A Christmas Memory&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;The Thanksgiving Visitor,&apos;&apos; for television.

                                                        Critics noted his deft handling of children as characters in his work, his ability to move from the real to the surreal, and his use of lush words and images. In 1963, the critic Mark Schorer wrote of Mr. Capote: &apos;&apos;Perhaps the single constant
                                                        in his prose is style, and the emphasis he himself places upon the importance of style.&apos;&apos;</p>
