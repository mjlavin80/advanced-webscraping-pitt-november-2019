                                                    <p> Frank Sinatra, the singer and actor whose extraordinary voice elevated popular song into an art, died on Thursday night in Los Angeles. He was 82. </p>
                                                    <p> The cause was a heart attack, said his publicity agent, Susan Reynolds. Ms. Reynolds said his fourth wife, Barbara, his son, Frank Jr., and daughters, Tina and Nancy, were at his side at Cedars-Sinai

He defined that role in the early 1940&apos;s when his first solo appearances
                                                        provoked the kind of mass pandemonium that later greeted Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

                                                    <p> During a show business career that spanned more than 50 years and comprised recordings, film and television as well as countless performances in nightclubs, concert halls and sports arenas, Sinatra stood

                                                        His evolution from the idealistic crooner of the early 1940&apos;s to the sophisticated swinger of the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s seemed to personify the country&apos;s loss of innocence. During World War II, Sinatra&apos;s tender romanticism served as the
                                                        dreamy emotional link between millions of women and their husbands and boyfriends fighting overseas. Reinventing himself in the 50&apos;s, the starry-eyed boy next door turned into the cosmopolitan
                                                        man of the world, a bruised romantic with a tough-guy streak and a song for every emotional season. </p>

                                                        In a series of brilliant conceptual albums, he codified a musical vocabulary of adult relationships with which millions identified. The haunted voice heard on a jukebox in the wee small hours of the morning lamenting the end of a love affair was the same
                                                        voice that jubilantly invited the world to &apos;&apos;come fly with me&apos;&apos; to exotic realms in a never-ending party.

                                                    <p> Sinatra appeared in 58 films, and won an Academy Award as best supporting actor for his portrayal of the feisty misfit soldier Maggio in &apos;&apos;From Here to Eternity&apos;&apos; (1953). As an actor,
                                                        he could communicate the same complex mixture of emotional honesty, vulnerability and cockiness that he projected as a singer, but he often chose his roles indifferently or unwisely. </p>

                                                        It was as a singer that he exerted the strongest cultural influence. Following his idol Bing Crosby, who had pioneered the use of the microphone, Sinatra transformed popular singing by infusing lyrics with a personal, intimate point of view that conveyed
                                                        a steady current of eroticism.

                                                        The skinny blue-eyed crooner, quickly nicknamed The Voice, made hordes of bobby-soxers swoon in the 1940&apos;s with an extraordinarily smooth and flexible baritone that he wielded with matchless skill. His mastery of long-lined phrasing inspired imitations
                                                        by many other male crooners, notably Dick Haymes, Vic Damone and Tony Bennett in the 1940&apos;s and 50&apos;s and most recently the pop jazz star Harry Connick Jr.

                                                        After the voice lost its velvety youthfulness, Sinatra&apos;s interpretations grew more personal and idiosyncratic, so that each performance became a direct expression of his personality and his mood of the moment. In expressing anger, petulance and bravado
                                                        -- attitudes that had largely been excluded from the acceptable vocabulary of pop feeling -- Sinatra paved the way for the unfettered vocal aggression of rock singers.

                                                    <p>The changes in Sinatra&apos;s vocal timbre coincided with a precipitous career descent in the late 1940&apos;s and early 50&apos;s. But in 1953, Sinatra made one of the most spectacular career comebacks
                                                        in show business history, re-emerging as a coarser-voiced, jazzier interpreter of popular standards who put a more aggressive personal stamp on his songs.

                                                    <p> Almost singlehandedly, he helped lead a revival of vocalized swing music that took American pop to a new level of musical sophistication. Coinciding with the rise of the long-playing record album, his
                                                        1950&apos;s recordings -- along with Ella Fitzgerald&apos;s &apos;&apos;song book&apos;&apos; albums saluting individual composers -- were instrumental in establishing a canon of American pop song
                                                        literature. </p>
                                                    <p> With Nelson Riddle, his most talented arranger, Sinatra defined the criteria for sound, style and song selection in pop recording during the pre-Beatles era. The aggressive uptempo style of Sinatra&apos;s
                                                        mature years spawned a genre of punchy, rhythmic belting associated with Las Vegas, which he was instrumental in establishing and popularizing as an entertainment capital.

                                                    <p> By the late 1950&apos;s, Sinatra had become so much the personification of American show business success that his life and his art became emblematic of the temper of the times. Except perhaps for Hugh
                                                        Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine, probably nobody did more to create a male ideal in the 1950&apos;s. For years, Sinatra seemed the embodiment of the hard-drinking, hedonistic swinger who
                                                        could have his pick of women and who was the leader of a party-loving entourage.

                                                    <p> That personality and wardrobe, borrowed in part from his friend Jimmy Van Heusen, the talented songwriter and man about town who liked to insouciantly sling his raincoat over his shoulder, was, in turn,
                                                        imitated by many other show business figures. It was a style Sinatra never entirely abandoned. Even in his later years, he would often stroll onto the stage with a drink in his hand. </p>
                                                    <p> On a deeper level, Sinatra&apos;s career and public image touched many aspects of American cultural life. For millions, his ascent from humble Italian-American roots in Hoboken, N.J., was a symbol of
                                                        ethnic achievement. And more than most entertainers, he used his influence to support political candidates. His change of allegiance from pro-Roosevelt Democrat in the 1940&apos;s to pro-Reagan Republican
                                                        in the 1980&apos;s paralleled a seismic shift in American politics.

                                                        Records (which he founded), Artanis (Sinatra spelled backward) Productions and Sinatra Enterprises.

                                                    <p> Sinatra was born in Hoboken on Dec. 12, 1915, the only child of Martin Sinatra, a boilermaker and sometime boxer from Catania, Sicily, and his wife, Natalie Garavante, who was nicknamed Dolly. The young
                                                        Francis Albert Sinatra attended Dave E. Rue Junior High School and Demarest High in Hoboken. He decided to become a singer either after attending a Crosby concert or seeing a Crosby film sometime
                                                        in 1931 or 1932. His mother encouraged his ambition, allowing him to drop out of high school.

Local radio exposure brought him to the attention of Harry
                                                        James, the trumpet player who had recently left Benny Goodman to form his own band. James signed Sinatra for $75 a week, and the singer made his first concert appearance with the James band in June
                                                        1939 and his first recording the next month.

                                                        from January 1940 until September 1942. His first successful record with the band was &apos;&apos;Polka Dots and Moonbeams.&apos;&apos; Six months after joining Dorsey, he scored his first No. 1

                                                        1939 with Harry James. The recording, &apos;&apos;All or Nothing at All,&apos;&apos; which had sold 8,000 copies in its first release, sold over a million. </p>
                                                    <p> Once the musicians&apos; strike was settled in November 1944, Sinatra began recording with Axel Stordahl, who had been a trombonist and lead arranger with Tommy Dorsey. Stordahl&apos;s sweet string-laced
                                                        settings for Sinatra&apos;s recordings silhouetted a yearning voice that one writer compared to &apos;&apos;worn velveteen.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> Until Sinatra left Columbia for Capitol Records in 1953, Stordahl remained his principal arranger. He also brilliantly exploited the songs of Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne, who tailored many of their ballads
                                                        to Sinatra&apos;s voice and style.

                                                    <p> Sinatra&apos;s first movie appearance was in 1940, singing with the Dorsey band in &apos;&apos;Las Vegas Nights.&apos;&apos; He made his movie acting debut in 1943, in &apos;&apos;Higher and Higher,&apos;&apos;
                                                        an innocuous bit of froth that was described by Bosley Crowther, movie critic for The New York Times, as &apos;&apos;a slapdash setting for the incredibly unctuous readings of the Voice.&apos;&apos;
                                                        The film was followed by &apos;&apos;Step Lively&apos;&apos; (1944) and &apos;&apos;Anchors Aweigh&apos;&apos; (1945), the first of three movies in which Sinatra played Gene Kelly&apos;s sidekick.
                                                        In these early films, Sinatra, often wearing a sailor suit and projecting a skinny soulfulness, played a wide-eyed innocent who was shy with women.

                                                    <p> In 1945, he also made &apos;&apos;The House I Live In,&apos;&apos; a 10-minute patriotic plea for racial and religious tolerance that won him a special Academy Award. Like his mother, Sinatra was an
                                                        ardent Democrat and supporter of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&apos;s New Deal. He visited the White House in 1944 and campaigned for Roosevelt in his bid for a fourth term as President. </p>

                                                        Sinatra&apos;s popularity remained at a peak through 1946, when he had 15 hit singles. Then it began a gradual slide that steepened after 1948 and hit bottom in 1952. As early as November 1947, an appearance at the Capitol Theater in New York drew disappointing
                                                        attendance. Only 4 Sinatra singles made the Top 10 in 1947, and the number dropped to one in 1948.

                                                        (1948), &apos;&apos;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&apos;&apos; (1949) and &apos;&apos;On the Town&apos;&apos; (1949) -- and one R.K.O. film, &apos;&apos;The Miracle of the Bells&apos;&apos; (1948),
                                                        in which he was miscast as a priest. After two more unsuccessful pictures, &apos;&apos;Double Dynamite&apos;&apos; (1951) and &apos;&apos;Meet Danny Wilson&apos;&apos; (1952), his movie career all

                                                        Part of the public disenchantment came after the columnist Robert Ruark denounced him in 1947 for having socialized with the deported gangster Lucky Luciano in Cuba. The suggestion that the singer consorted with criminals made him a target of the conservative
                                                        press, which resented his pro-Roosevelt political stance. For the rest of Sinatra&apos;s career, stories of his relations with the underworld dogged him, and he reacted angrily to the charges.

Divorce and Remarriage; Career Troubles </b>

In 1949 he had begun an affair with the movie star Ava Gardner. The relationship became public the next year, and on November 7, 1951, one week after
                                                        his divorce was final, he married her in Philadelphia.

                                                    <p> Passionate but stormy, the marriage lasted just less than two years. MGM announced their separation in October 1953, and they were divorced in 1957. (She died in 1990.)
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Those personal upheavals, including a suicide attempt, coincided with increasing tension between Sinatra and Columbia Records after Mitch Miller took the company&apos;s creative reins in 1950.

                                                        duet with the television personality Dagmar that included dog imitations by Donald Baine.

                                                    <p> Sinatra&apos;s phenomenal resurgence began in 1953 with the release of &apos;&apos;From Here to Eternity,&apos;&apos; Fred Zinnemann&apos;s film version of James Jones&apos;s best-selling novel about

                                                    <p> In April 1953, Sinatra, then 37, had signed with Capitol Records. A cautious deal, the contract was for only one year, with no advance. Sinatra arrived at Capitol just when his voice had lost most of
                                                        its youthful sheen, but the move proved fortunate. Only five years earlier, the long-playing record had been introduced, and the longer form encouraged Sinatra, who brought remarkable introspective
                                                        depth to the interpretation of lyrics, to make cohesive album-length emotional statements.

                                                        the label. A trombonist who had also worked with Tommy Dorsey, Riddle pioneered in augmenting a big-band lineup with strings, and he was the master of an elegant pop impressionism that enhanced Sinatra&apos;s
                                                        vocal image of urbane sophistication. On a series of classic pop albums for Capitol, the singer and arranger virtually reinvented swing music for a more opulent era.

                                                        that were at once jazzier and more operatic. The album, which included his classic recording of &apos;&apos;What&apos;s New,&apos;&apos; inspired Linda Ronstadt&apos;s hit 1983 album &apos;&apos;What&apos;s
                                                        New,&apos;&apos; which in turn spurred a revival of interest in elegant 50&apos;s pop styles. </p>

                                                        Joey Bishop. The group was an outgrowth of a social circle that had centered on Humphrey Bogart, who died in 1957. The Rat Packers would appear together in three more lighthearted capers: &apos;&apos;Sergeants

Kennedy in 1960 and supervised the newly elected President&apos;s inaugural gala in Washington in January 1961. But his pro-Kennedy sentiments cooled
                                                        after the President canceled a weekend visit to Sinatra&apos;s house because the singer had played host to the Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana and his associates. And in 1963, the singer lost his Nevada

                                                    <p>Sinatra toured the world in 1989 with Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli in a concert package billed as &apos;&apos;the ultimate event.&apos;&apos; It was one of the grander bills in a rigorous touring
                                                        schedule that he maintained into his late 70&apos;s. He toured with Shirley MacLaine in 1992. Increasingly during his performances in later years he resorted to using electronic prompters at the
                                                        front of the stage to read lyrics. </p>
                                                    <p> In 1993, at the age of 77, Sinatra had an astounding recording-career comeback with &apos;&apos;Frank Sinatra Duets,&apos;&apos; a collection of 13 Sinatra standards rerecorded with such pop stars as
                                                        Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross and Bono of the Irish rock group U2. The record was widely criticized for being an engineering stunt, since none of the guest singers
                                                        were actually in the recording studio with Sinatra, who recorded his parts separately. The record nevertheless sold over two million copies in the United States. A year later, there was a weaker
                                                        follow-up using a different roster of guests.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Sinatra&apos;s last concert was on Feb. 25, 1995, at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom in Palm Desert, Calif.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Assessing his own abilities in 1963, Sinatra sounded a note that was quintessentially characteristic: forlorn and tough. &apos;&apos;Being an 18-karat manic-depressive, and having lived a life of violent
                                                        emotional contradictions, I have an overacute capacity for sadness as well as elation,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;Whatever else has been said about me personally is unimportant. When I sing,
                                                        I believe, I&apos;m honest.&apos;&apos; </p>
