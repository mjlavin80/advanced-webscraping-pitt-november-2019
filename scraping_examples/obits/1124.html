                                                        Dale Carnegie, whose book &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; was one of the world&apos;s most phenomenal bestsellers, died yesterday at his home, 27 Wendover Road, Forest Hills, Queens. He had been ill for some time. He would have been
                                                        67 years old on Nov. 24.

                                                        Mr. Carnegie was born in poverty on a Missouri farm, but found that a silver tongue could be more useful than a silver spoon in winning wealth and fame. While a student at State Teachers College, Warrensburg, Mo., he had to live at home because he was
                                                        too poor to pay $1 a day for room and board. When he found he could not compete with the campus athletes for popularity, he took to public speaking. He felt this activity would cure his feeling of
                                                        inferiority.

                                                    <p>
                                                        After graduation in 1908, Mr. Carnegie failed at several jobs before he started to earn a living here in 1912 as a teacher of public speaking in classes at the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association.

It has had fifty-two printings in the paperback edition, while the regular edition has just gone through its
                                                        seventy-first printing. From last March to last September, more than 20,000 copies of the hardcover edition were sold. It has been translated into twenty-nine languages and was said by the spokesman
                                                        to be second only to the Bible in nonfiction sales.

The review observed that
                                                        there was &quot;a subtle cynicism&quot; in this approach, but that the book offered some &quot;simple sound, practical common sense.&quot;

Joined Debating Team

                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Carnegie was born in Maryville, Mo., the second son of James William and Amanda Elizabeth Carnegie. After the family moved to Warrensburg, Dale Carnegie found he had an aptitude for reciting, and while in high school joined the debating team. He became
                                                        so impressed with the style of a speaker at a Chautauqua lecture that he decided to emulate him. It is said he practiced recitations on the horse he rode to and from college.

                                                        Mr. Carnegie later became a salesman at Alliance, Neb., for the International Correspondence Schools, and for the meat-packing concern of Armour &amp; Co. By 1911, when he had saved $500, an acquaintance persuaded him to become an actor. He studied at
                                                        the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and later played the part of Dr. Hartley in a road show of &quot;Polly and the Circus.&quot; This experience turned him from the theatre. His career as a teacher
                                                        of public speaking started soon thereafter.

                                                        After a year and a half of Army service at Camp Upton on Long Island in World War I, Mr. Carnegie became business manager for Lowell Thomas, who was on a lecture tour. After the tour, Mr. Carnegie continued his teaching of public speaking.
