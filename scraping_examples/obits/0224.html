When those squadrons came into being at his insistence, the Navy was prepared to

                                                        During the first half of 1944, Admiral Nimitz employed the main fighting strength of the Pacific Navy in the central Pacific. The bloody victory at Tarawa was followed by the &quot;great turkey shoot&quot; in the Marianas, where United States aviators
                                                        downed 402 out of 545 Japanese planes sighted.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At his headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Nimitz set an example to his staff by keeping in the peak of physical condition.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He swam and took long walks, his pet schnauzer dog trotting along with him. Sometimes at night, he took a drink of bourbon whisky to relax.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        While waiting for news of a Navy engagement, he would go to the firing range and grimly fire his pistol, or stand in his kitchen and make jelly from prickly pears he grew outside his quarters. Subordinates dutifully tasted the jelly, which he made by
                                                        a recipe from his boyhood days.

                                                        In November, 1945, with the war over, Admiral Nimitz became one of the senior naval officers elevated to the newly created rank of Admiral of the Fleet, a rank equivalent to that of General of the Army, or Field Marshal in the service of other countries.

                                                    <p>
                                                        After the war, Admiral Nimitz continued to be honored for his brilliant wartime service. He received major decorations from 11 foreign countries, including the British Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. Fifteen universities and colleges awarded him
                                                        honorary degrees.

                                                        In 1949, Admiral Nimitz was named by the United Nations secretariat to supervise a proposed plebiscite to determine whether Kashmir should become part of India or should be linked to Pakistan. International complications kept the plebiscite commission
                                                        from functioning.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        President Harry S. Truman appointed Admiral Nimitz to head a committee on Internal Security and Individual Rights. Because of opposition in Congress the committee never functioned.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although he had commanded 1,000 ships and two million men in World War II, Admiral Nimitz refused to write memoirs. He allowed others to organize birthday parties for him in his later years, but not without grumbling. On his 75th birthday, he was asked
                                                        if he were looking forward to the celebration.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to the end of it,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel the same way about it as the man who bought himself a small boat. His two happiest days were when he bought it and when he sold it.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        Besides his wife, he leaves a son, Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz Jr., retired, and three daughters, Mrs. Catherine Vance Lay of Newport, R.I., Mary Monson Nimitz, a nun in the Dominican Convent at San Rafael, Calif., and Miss Anne Elizabeth Nimitz of Topanga,

                                                        When Admiral Nimitz took over the Pacific Fleet on Dec. 31, 1941, many of its ships lay at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, sunk by the Japanese in the surprise attack of Dec. 7 on Hawaii.

                                                        Without haste--Admiral Nimitz always proceeded with care--he directed the deployment of such carriers and cruises as were left, to hold the line until that moment perhaps two years away, when new battleships could be ready.

                                                        With Adm. Ernest King, chief of naval operations, President Roosevelt and the Navy&apos;s other strategy planners, Admiral Nimitz had to undergo the anguish of being unable to answer the cry of soldiers trapped on Bataan:

                                                        When the new battleships, cruisers, carriers and destroyers did arrive, Admiral Nimitz and the Navy cleared the seas of Japanese warships in a series of spectacular naval battles.

He was nicknamed &quot;Matty&quot; because his proficiency in setting-up exercises, was second only to that of Matty Strohm, the academy&apos;s physical education instruction.

In his early days in the Navy he commanded an assortment of obsolete minor vessels, and was much pleased when he received command
                                                        of the old destroyer Stephen Decatur. During a storm, the engineer of the destroyer telephoned from the engine room that the vessel was taking on water rapidly and soon would sink. Lieutenant Nimitz
                                                        replied soothingly:

He wore this medal throughout the remainder of his career, along with the five Distinguished Service Medal awards for wartime exploits.

By way of a honeymoon, the young officer was assigned to study diesel engines in Germany and Belgium for a year. On his return to the United States, he built the Navy&apos;s first diesel engine at the
                                                        New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn. While he was demonstrating the engine his left hand was caught in the mechanism, and one of his fingers was severed.

He picked up his hat and went down to the office of the Chief of Naval Operations for orders. A few days later,
                                                        Admiral Kimmel was relieved and Admiral Nimitz was on his way to Pearl Harbor.

                                                        the extent of damage to the fleet in the Pearl Harbor attack.

While waiting for United States yards to turn out the ships
                                                        he needed, Admiral Nimitz built up his combat teams. These were commanded by Admirals William F. Halsey, Mare A. Mitschner, Richmond K. Turner, Raymond A. Spruance, and Thomas C. Kincaid.

Once when a sailor from Texas dropped in on him at Pacific Fleet headquarters to chat, Admiral Nimitz sent for a Navy photographer to take a picture.

When those squadrons came into being at his insistence, the Navy was prepared to
                                                        take the fight to the Japanese.

This was the world&apos;s first naval battle fought entirely in the air, without the carriers even sighting each other or a shot being exchanged between surface

The bloody victory at Tarawa was followed by the &quot;great turkey shoot&quot; in the Marianas, where United States aviators
