                                                        Until the morning of April 12, 1961, Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin was no better known than any of the other 1,200 or so Gagarins living in the Moscow area.

                                                    </p>

                                                        and the powerful force of socialism.&quot;

Streets were named for him in many Soviet cities, monuments were erected, and Government officials pinned medals on his tunic. Premier Nikita Krushchev publicly smothered him
                                                        with kisses, compared him to Christopher Columbus, and named him a Hero of the Soviet Union.

                                                        Yuri Gagarin was a rather quiet man, mild-spoken almost to a fault. He had intelligent, dark eyes and bushy eyebrows. His forehead was broad and his nose snubbed, and persons who knew him said he had the appearance and demeanor of &quot;a typical Muskovite.&quot;

                                                        He was born March 9, 1934 on a collective farm near Gzhatsk, in the state of Smolenskaya, about 100 miles from Moscow. His father, Aleksei, was a carpenter, and his mother, Anna, worked in the fields.

But the cosmonaut angrily denied any connection with that
                                                        aristocratic lineage.

Gzhatsk was directly on the historic invasion path to Moscow, and by late September
                                                        Nazi Panzer tanks had overrun it.

The family returned to Ghatsk from exile in the Urals when the war ended, and Yuri was sent to an industrial school in a Moscow
                                                        suburb.

He was graduated with distinction from the industrial school and while working as a molder attended night school for workers and completed
                                                        secondary school studies. While studying for a technical degree at Saratov, he learned to fly with the local aero club.

On the eve of the Vostok flight, he was promoted to major, and at the time of his death was a full colonel. After his great leap forward into space, he did not
                                                        make a second space flight, but it is understood he played a major part in training pilots for future flights.

After attaining the first escape velocity and the separation of the last stage of the carrier rocket, the spaceship went into free flight that circled the earth only once.

Colonel Gagarin served as chairman of the Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society, and as a delegate to the 22d Congress of the Communist

                                                        and the powerful force of socialism.&quot;

Streets were named for him in many Soviet cities, monuments were erected, and Government officials pinned medals on his tunic. Premier Nikita Krushchev publicly smothered him
                                                        with kisses, compared him to Christopher Columbus, and named him a Hero of the Soviet Union.

                                                        Yuri Gagarin was a rather quiet man, mild-spoken almost to a fault. He had intelligent, dark eyes and bushy eyebrows. His forehead was broad and his nose snubbed, and persons who knew him said he had the appearance and demeanor of &quot;a typical Muskovite.&quot;

                                                        He was born March 9, 1934 on a collective farm near Gzhatsk, in the state of Smolenskaya, about 100 miles from Moscow. His father, Aleksei, was a carpenter, and his mother, Anna, worked in the fields.

But the cosmonaut angrily denied any connection with that
                                                        aristocratic lineage.

Gzhatsk was directly on the historic invasion path to Moscow, and by late September
                                                        Nazi Panzer tanks had overrun it.

The family returned to Ghatsk from exile in the Urals when the war ended, and Yuri was sent to an industrial school in a Moscow

He was graduated with distinction from the industrial school and while working as a molder attended night school for workers and completed
                                                        secondary school studies. While studying for a technical degree at Saratov, he learned to fly with the local aero club.

                                                        In 1957, Colonel Gagarin graduated from an air force cadet school at Orenburg, where he met his wife, Valentina, a graduate of the Orenburg Medical school. Soon after his marriage, he began a tour of duty as a fighter pilot.

                                                        As a senior lieutenant, he was in the first group of pilots to be trained for space flights. On the eve of the Vostok flight, he was promoted to major, and at the time of his death was a full colonel. After his great leap forward into space, he did not
                                                        make a second space flight, but it is understood he played a major part in training pilots for future flights.

After attaining the first escape velocity and the separation of the last stage of the carrier rocket, the spaceship went into free flight that circled the earth only once.

Colonel Gagarin served as chairman of the Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society, and as a delegate to the 22d Congress of the Communist
