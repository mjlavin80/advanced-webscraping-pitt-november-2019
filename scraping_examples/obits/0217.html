One of his proudest &quot;selling&quot; jobs was the negotiation of a $40,000 loan, without
                                                        the customary collateral, from the Guaranty Trust Company of New York--of which he later became a director.

In 1952, the Government started a civil antitrust suit against I.B.M., charging that the corporation owned
                                                        more than 90 per cent of all tabulating machines used in the United States. Its rentals were estimated at $100,000,000 annually.

Under this decree, the company agreed to offer its machines for sale, to set up a separate company

                                                    <p>
                                                        Thomas J. Watson Sr., who built the fabulous International Business Machines Corporation, died of a heart attack yesterday in Roosevelt Hospital. He was 82 years old and had been hospitalized since Sunday.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Often called &quot;the world&apos;s greatest salesman,&quot; Mr. Watson was the company&apos;s board chairman at his death. On May 8 he had turned over the post of chief executive officer to his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., who has been president since
                                                        Jan. 15, 1952.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The elder Mr. Watson last appeared at his office in the subsidiary I.B.M. World Trade Corporation, of which he was also board chairman, on May 28. The office is at 807 United Nations Plaza.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Watson had been living at his summer home, 88 Weed Street, New Canaan, Conn., where he was stricken over the week-end. Present when he died were his wife and their four children.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Watson was of that breed of capitalists to whom the accumulation of huge personal fortune and the building of a vast business empire became opportunities for the spreading of huge personal benefactions and the accomplishment of widespread public service.
                                                    </p>

                                                        To a great extent, the International Business Machines Corporation is a reflection of the character of the man who led it to a position of eminence among the business machine manufacturers of the world.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        From the slogans that adorn its walls in eighty nations and the expenditures made form its treasury for good works, to the methods by which it introduces recruits to what may be called the I.B.M. way of life, the company is the creature of the man who
                                                        commanded it for forty-two years.

                                                    <p>
                                                        His was a time not so much of smoothly efficient, colorless corporate management as of intensely personal direction. Mr. Watson led I.B.M. from an uncertain amalgam of smaller companies to a position so akin to a monopoly that competitors and Government
                                                        antitrust officials haled it into court.

                                                        It would have cost $2,750 to buy 100 shares of the company&apos;s stock in 1914, the year Mr. Watson took over. Anyone exercising rights accruing to those shares through 1925 would have increased his cash investment to $6,364 for 153 shares.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Such a person would now hold 3,990 shares, and would have obtained a value of $2,164,000 based on market prices this year and cash dividends of $209,000 paid thus far.

                                                        Mr. Watson&apos;s own first earnings were $6 a week. His I.B.M. compensation, based on salary and percentage of net profits, climbed to a Government-announced $546,294 in 1940. It was surpassed that year only by the $704,425 received by Louis B. Mayer,

In the early days of the depression, he kept his plants going and added to his sales force. Even during that era&apos;s darkest hours
                                                        he refused to lay off factory help. Instead, he piled up a massive inventory of parts for which there was no immediate use.

To stimulate himself and others, Mr. Watson had a &quot;THINK&quot; sign made-- the first of thousands--and hung it in the conference room.

                                                        John H. Patterson, head of the company, was so impressed with it that he ordered copies for every office in his organization. Later, Mr. Watson made it possible for I.B.M. employes to gaze in almost any direction without losing sight of the admonition

                                                        His first job with the National Cash Register Company was an itinerant salesman. Mr. Watson was no smashing success, and after ten days on the road, during which he had not sold a machine, he returned for a talk with his sales supervisor.
                                                    </p>

                                                        The supervisor administered a pep talk, littered with homilies of the kind that football coaches find useful between the halves.

                                                        The effect of this conference was such that Mr. Watson was ever afterward a champion of the catchword and of the idea that one of the chief duties of a supervisor is the encouragement of those below him.

Its products were a punch-card tabulator, which had been invented in time for use in the 1890 census; time clocks and other business machines.
                                                        In February, 1924, the company was merged with the International Business Machines Corporation and assumed its name.

                                                        He developed the concept of the industrial &quot;family,&quot; whose duties were first to the customer, who must receive good value for his money; next to the members of the &quot;family,&quot; who must receive proper compensation; and then to the owners
                                                        of the corporation, who must receive profits.

                                                        For the customer, Mr. Watson saw to it that new machines were devised to meet new needs and new needs were discovered to stimulate the sale of new and old machines. One of his proudest &quot;selling&quot; jobs was the negotiation of a $40,000 loan, without
                                                        the customary collateral, from the Guaranty Trust Company of New York--of which he later became a director.

                                                        Most of the borrowed funds were used for the establishment of an engineering laboratory for the development of new machines. Greatly enlarged, the corporation&apos;s laboratories have contributed to the I.B.M. catalogue, which includes computers, machines
                                                        for simultaneously weighing and counting items, translators for the simultaneous broadcast of a speech in several languages, intricate calculating machines and other scientific specialties.

In 1952, the Government started a civil antitrust suit against I.B.M., charging that the corporation owned
                                                        more than 90 per cent of all tabulating machines used in the United States. Its rentals were estimated at $100,000,000 annually.

Under this decree, the company agreed to offer its machines for sale, to set up a separate company
                                                        to service machines, to supply parts and data to other companies servicing equipment and to release its patents for licensing.
