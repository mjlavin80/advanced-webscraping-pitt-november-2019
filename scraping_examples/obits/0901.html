The plane was cleared for landing and broke through the scattered clouds at 400 feet. But it was short of the airport and clipped treetops.
                                                        It came down burning, crashing a mile and a half southwest of the airport and exploding. The bodies were burned beyond recognition except through dental records.

                                                        President Nixon called Mr. Reuther&apos;s death &quot;a deep loss not only for organized labor but also for the cause of collective bargaining and the entire American process.&quot; Mr. Nixon added:

                                                        leader had often found himself at odds.
