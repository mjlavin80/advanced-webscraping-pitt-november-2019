                                                        could personally inform his friends of his passing, All 101 of Mr. L&apos;Amour&apos;s books - 86 novels, 14 short-story collections and one full-length work of nonfiction - are in print, and with
                                                        almost 200 million copies in circulation, he was one of the world&apos;s most popular writers. Former President Jimmy Carter was reading &apos;&apos;The Lonesome Gods&apos;&apos; on an airplane trip

                                                    <p>
                                                        On his way to the best-seller list, Mr. L&apos;Amour worked at almost everything but writing. Before he handed in his first western - &apos;&apos;Hondo,&apos;&apos; in 1953 - he had been a longshoreman, a lumberjack, an elephant handler, a fruit picker
                                                        and an officer on a tank destroyer in World War II. He had also circled the world on a freighter, sailed a dhow on the Red Sea, been shipwrecked in the West Indies and been stranded in the Mojave
                                                        Desert, and had won 51 of 59 fights as a professional boxer.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But he was certain that someday he would make his living as a writer. Since 1816, 33 members of his family had done so; and Mr. L&apos;Amour, who had wanted to be a writer &apos;&apos;almost from the time I could walk,&apos;&apos; was confident of his
                                                        talent. &apos;&apos;I could sit in the middle of Sunset Boulevard and write with my typewriter on my knees,&apos;&apos; he once said. &apos;&apos;Temperamental I am not.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p>
                                                        But at times he did seem annoyed that critics paid little attention to westerns. He attributed this to the literary world&apos;s &apos;&apos;pure snobbishness.&apos;&apos;</p>

                                                        &apos;&apos;If you write a book about a bygone period that lies east of the Mississippi River, then it&apos;s a historical novel,&apos;&apos; he said in 1975. &apos;&apos;If it&apos;s west of the Mississippi, it&apos;s a western, a different category.
                                                        There&apos;s no sense to it.&apos;&apos;

                                                        For his part, Mr. L&apos;Amour considered himself something of a latter-day Chaucer. &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t travel and tell stories, because that&apos;s not the way these days,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;But I write my books to be read aloud and
                                                        I think of myself in that oral tradition.&apos;&apos;

                                                        The result was a strong sense of time and place, the result of L&apos;Amour&apos;s meticulous attention to details. When he wrote about mountains, he was geologically correct. When he wrote about guns, he wrote for the gun specialist. He checked what
                                                        food people ate in a given time and place, he memorized architectural details and often took camping trips to familiarize himself with the landscapes he was writing about.

                                                        In the typical L&apos;Amour book, law triumps over lawlessness and order over chaos. But he was less concerned with stereotypes of good guys and bad guys than with his characters&apos; spunkiness.
                                                    </p>

                                                        The typical L&apos;Amour hero was a strapping young man in his late teens or early 20&apos;s, a resilient and somewhat romantic fighter bent on self-improvement. Tell Sackett carried law books in his saddlebags; Bendigo Shafter read Montaigne, Plutarch
                                                        and Thoreau; and Drake Morrel, a one-time riverboat gambler, read Juvenal in the original Latin.

He was a son of a veterinarian who doubled as a farm-machinery salesman, grandson of a Civil War veteran
                                                        and great-grandson of a settler who had been scalped by Sioux warriors.

By the time he was 20, he had skinned cattle in Texas, lived with bandits in Tibet and worked on an East African schooner.

                                                        Louis L&apos;Amour, who turned out novel after best-selling novel about plain-speaking, straight-shooting heroes of the old West, died Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 80 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. L&apos;Amour&apos;s editor at Bantam Books, Stuart S. Applebaum, said Mr. L&apos;Amour, a nonsmoker, had died of lung cancer. Mr. Applebaum said the L&apos;Amour family delayed the announcement of Mr. L&apos;Amour&apos;s death by one day so that they
                                                        could personally inform his friends of his passing, All 101 of Mr. L&apos;Amour&apos;s books - 86 novels, 14 short-story collections and one full-length work of nonfiction - are in print, and with
                                                        almost 200 million copies in circulation, he was one of the world&apos;s most popular writers. Former President Jimmy Carter was reading &apos;&apos;The Lonesome Gods&apos;&apos; on an airplane trip
                                                        last week, and President Reagan read &apos;&apos;Jubal Sackett&apos;&apos; while recovering from cancer surgery in 1985.</p>
                                                    <p>&apos;&apos;I guess I&apos;m an industry,&apos;&apos; he said a decade ago.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was the first novelist to be awarded a Congressional gold medal, an award given to Charles A. Lindbergh, Thomas A. Edison, Marian Anderson and Dr. Jonas Salk, among others.</p>
                                                    <p><b>A Vast Array of Experiences</b> </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        On his way to the best-seller list, Mr. L&apos;Amour worked at almost everything but writing. Before he handed in his first western - &apos;&apos;Hondo,&apos;&apos; in 1953 - he had been a longshoreman, a lumberjack, an elephant handler, a fruit picker
                                                        and an officer on a tank destroyer in World War II. He had also circled the world on a freighter, sailed a dhow on the Red Sea, been shipwrecked in the West Indies and been stranded in the Mojave
                                                        Desert, and had won 51 of 59 fights as a professional boxer.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But he was certain that someday he would make his living as a writer. Since 1816, 33 members of his family had done so; and Mr. L&apos;Amour, who had wanted to be a writer &apos;&apos;almost from the time I could walk,&apos;&apos; was confident of his
                                                        talent. &apos;&apos;I could sit in the middle of Sunset Boulevard and write with my typewriter on my knees,&apos;&apos; he once said. &apos;&apos;Temperamental I am not.&apos;&apos;

                                                        There&apos;s no sense to it.&apos;&apos;

                                                        For his part, Mr. L&apos;Amour considered himself something of a latter-day Chaucer. &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t travel and tell stories, because that&apos;s not the way these days,&apos;&apos; he said. &apos;&apos;But I write my books to be read aloud and
                                                        I think of myself in that oral tradition.&apos;&apos;

                                                        The result was a strong sense of time and place, the result of L&apos;Amour&apos;s meticulous attention to details. When he wrote about mountains, he was geologically correct. When he wrote about guns, he wrote for the gun specialist. He checked what
                                                        food people ate in a given time and place, he memorized architectural details and often took camping trips to familiarize himself with the landscapes he was writing about.

                                                        In the typical L&apos;Amour book, law triumps over lawlessness and order over chaos. But he was less concerned with stereotypes of good guys and bad guys than with his characters&apos; spunkiness.

                                                        The typical L&apos;Amour hero was a strapping young man in his late teens or early 20&apos;s, a resilient and somewhat romantic fighter bent on self-improvement. Tell Sackett carried law books in his saddlebags; Bendigo Shafter read Montaigne, Plutarch
                                                        and Thoreau; and Drake Morrel, a one-time riverboat gambler, read Juvenal in the original Latin.

He was a son of a veterinarian who doubled as a farm-machinery salesman, grandson of a Civil War veteran
                                                        and great-grandson of a settler who had been scalped by Sioux warriors.

By the time he was 20, he had skinned cattle in Texas, lived with bandits in Tibet and worked on an East African schooner.
