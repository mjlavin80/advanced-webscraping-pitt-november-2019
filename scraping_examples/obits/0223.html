                                                        For more than half a century, William Edward Burghardt DuBois was a monumental and often controversial, leader of Negro thought.

                                                        As a sociologist, educator and writer, he frequently disagreed not only with whites but with members of his own race. Early in his career, he challenged the philosophy of Booker T. Washington. Dr. DuBois was one of the founders of the National Association
                                                        for the Advancement of Colored People, but later broke with the organization under conditions of bitterness.

                                                        During his later years, he was active in many left-wing and Communist activities. In the fall of 1961--at the age of 93--he joined the Communist party. At about the same time, he went to Ghana as head of the secretariat planning the new Negro encyclopedia.

                                                        Dr. DuBois was born in Great Barrington, Mass., on Feb. 23, 1868, five years after the Emancipation Proclamation. He was born, as he phrased it in his autobiography, &quot;Dusk at Dawn,&quot; &quot;with a flood of Negro blood, a strain of French, a bit
                                                        of Dutch, but, thank God, no &apos;Anglo-Saxon.&apos;&quot;

                                                        In Great Barrington, a tolerant, provincial town, Dr. DuBois grew up as one of about 50 Negroes among 5,000 inhabitants. His mother&apos;s family, among whom he was raised, had lived in a relatively humble situation in a community where social status
                                                        was determined by income and ancestry and not by color.

                                                        Because of this economic leveling, Dr. DuBois was not faced with racial discrimination until he had left New England to attend college in the South.

                                                        Dr. DuBois disagreed with the doctrine of Booker T. Washington that the Negro should raise himself by his own bootstraps and strive for an education basically vocational. Dr. DuBois envisioned the education of a &quot;talented 10th&quot; that would lead
                                                        a self-sufficient Negro society.

For the next 10 years, he taught at Atlanta once more, only to resign again in 1944 to return to the N.A.A.C.P. as director of research. Four years
                                                        later, after another disagreement, he left the N.A.A.C.P. for good.

                                                        As a sociologist, educator and writer, he frequently disagreed not only with whites but with members of his own race. Early in his career, he challenged the philosophy of Booker T. Washington. Dr. DuBois was one of the founders of the National Association
                                                        for the Advancement of Colored People, but later broke with the organization under conditions of bitterness.

                                                        During his later years, he was active in many left-wing and Communist activities. In the fall of 1961--at the age of 93--he joined the Communist party. At about the same time, he went to Ghana as head of the secretariat planning the new Negro encyclopedia.

                                                        Dr. DuBois was born in Great Barrington, Mass., on Feb. 23, 1868, five years after the Emancipation Proclamation. He was born, as he phrased it in his autobiography, &quot;Dusk at Dawn,&quot; &quot;with a flood of Negro blood, a strain of French, a bit
                                                        of Dutch, but, thank God, no &apos;Anglo-Saxon.&apos;&quot;

                                                        In Great Barrington, a tolerant, provincial town, Dr. DuBois grew up as one of about 50 Negroes among 5,000 inhabitants. His mother&apos;s family, among whom he was raised, had lived in a relatively humble situation in a community where social status
                                                        was determined by income and ancestry and not by color.

                                                        Because of this economic leveling, Dr. DuBois was not faced with racial discrimination until he had left New England to attend college in the South.

                                                        Dr. DuBois disagreed with the doctrine of Booker T. Washington that the Negro should raise himself by his own bootstraps and strive for an education basically vocational. Dr. DuBois envisioned the education of a &quot;talented 10th&quot; that would lead
                                                        a self-sufficient Negro society.

For the next 10 years, he taught at Atlanta once more, only to resign again in 1944 to return to the N.A.A.C.P. as director of research. Four years
