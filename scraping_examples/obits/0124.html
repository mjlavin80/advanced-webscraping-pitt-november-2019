                                                        Edith Wharton was the child as well as the author of the Age of Innocence. In her seventy-five years of life she published thirty-eight books, including that great love story, &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; But her reputation rested mostly upon her achievement
                                                        as the chronicler of Fifth Avenue, when the brownstone front hid wealth and dignity at its ease upon the antimacassar-covered plush chairs of the Brown Decade.

                                                        As a child she lived within the inner circle of New York society that always thought of itself as spelled with a capital S. In her ancestry was a long succession of important names. The Schermerhorns, the Joneses, Pendletons, Stevenses, Ledyards, Rhinelanders
                                                        and Gallatins, who had led the social life of New York before Mrs. Astor&apos;s horse was a symbol, before Commodore from Staten Island, or men with strange new names from the West had descended
                                                        on the town. Her own father, although not overly rich, was, nevertheless, able to live, as she said, &quot;a life of leisure and amiable hospitality.&quot;

When little Edith walked on the Avenue she passed nothing but brownstone and the cow pasture of the Misses Kennedy. When she went on Bailey&apos;s Beach she shielded her fair skin from
                                                        the sun with a black veil. When she went to Europe it was an escape from the crudities of American society--even that with a capital S. Innocence was the life of her childhood and it was the stuff
                                                        of her better books.

                                                        Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones on Jan. 24, 1862. Her father was George Frederick Jones; her mother was the former Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, and back of each were Colonial and Revolutionary ancestors. When she was 4 the family went abroad
                                                        in pursuit of culture, health and economy, for her father&apos;s inherited funds had not increased during the Civil War that was just ended.

                                                        Her early impressions were the international--New York and Newport, Rome, Paris and Madrid. Added to this was a vivid imagination, which found outlet in story telling even before she could read. In keeping with the sheltered life of the time, she was
                                                        never sent to school, but was taught at home. She began writing short stories in her early teens, but they were never about &quot;real people.&quot; Little happened to the real people she knew; what
                                                        did &quot;happen&quot; was generally not talked about.

                                                        It was from this background that Mrs. Wharton was to inherit the belief from which she never departed, that &quot;any one gifted with the least creative faculty knows the absurdity of such a charge&quot; as that of &quot;putting flesh-and-blood people
                                                        into books.&quot; Later critics were to say that in this was her greatest lack.

                                                        The young author wrote her first efforts on brown paper salvaged from parcels. She was not encouraged. &quot;In the eyes of our provincial society,&quot; she was later to say, &quot;authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a
                                                        form of manual labor.&quot; Each was equally despised in her social level. Her first acceptance was three poems which she sent to the editor with her calling card attached.

Wrote a Novel at 11</b>

Her first novel, written when she as 11, began: &quot;&apos;Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Brown?&apos; said Mrs. Tompkins. &apos;If only I had known

                                                        Her first published book was a collaboration called &quot;The Decoration of Homes.&quot; How many short stories she wrote before 1899 is not know. But she was encouraged in her writing by such friends as Egerton Winthrop and Walter Berry and somehow,
                                                        while abroad, met Paul Bourget, the &quot;chronicler of the bourgeoisie.&quot; Other mentors were William Brownell and Edward Burlingame, for many years editor of Scribner&apos;s Magazine. In her
                                                        autobiography she writes: &quot;I do not think I have ever forgotten one word of the counsels they gave me.&quot; To which a well- known critic added, &quot;One well believes it.&quot;

                                                        But it was Henry James who was her closest friend and most worth-while advocate. She was always his respectful disciple and, although in their many meetings he disguised the severity of his judgments with his usual elaborate verbal courtesies, he managed
                                                        to convey the meaning of his criticism. He remained her close friend until his death.

                                                        This volume did not make her a wide reputation overnight. In fact, it was not until 1905 that she gained a large public, although in the interim there had appeared these books: &quot;The Touchstone,&quot;
                                                        &quot;Crucial Instances,&quot; &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Man and Other Stories,&quot; and her flare for travel books had asserted itself in two volumes on Italy,

This was in reality her first novel, although she had written long
                                                        short stories in her other books. Its title came from the biblical assertion, &quot;The heart of fools is in the House of Mirth,&quot; and it was a happy title for projecting, as Wilbur Cross once
                                                        put it, &quot;a group of pleasure-loving New Yorkers, mostly as dull as they are immoral, and letting them play out their drama unmolested by others.&quot;

                                                        de Treymes,&quot; in which certain French critics detected the influence of Flaubert and Maupassant; &quot;The Fruit of the Tree,&quot; &quot;The Hermit and the Wild Woman&quot; and &quot;Artemis

In it she most successfully blended the psychological refinements she had learned from Henry James with her own inimitable ability to tell a story with
                                                        a beginning and an end. One critic has said it is comparable only to the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne as a tragedy of New England life. A novelette, it is considered a masterpiece of love and frustration,
                                                        and is likely to stand, despite its comparative brevity, as her most accomplished work.

She also fed and housed 600 Belgian

                                                        But that was many years ago.

                                                        That generation which knew her best for &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; flocked to see &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; when it was adapted for the stage by Owen Davis and his son, Donald. Presented on Broadway with Pauline Lord, Ruth Gordon and Raymond Massey
                                                        in the leading roles, the grim tragedy proved to be as good theatre as it had previously been a great book.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; was not the only one of her books to have been translated into plays in recent years. &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; helped add to the luster of Katharine Cornell eight years ago, and one of her shorter pieces became &quot;The
                                                        Old Maid&quot; of the theatre, in which Judith Anderson and Helen Menken starred in 1935.

                                                        Edith Wharton was the child as well as the author of the Age of Innocence. In her seventy-five years of life she published thirty-eight books, including that great love story, &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; But her reputation rested mostly upon her achievement
                                                        as the chronicler of Fifth Avenue, when the brownstone front hid wealth and dignity at its ease upon the antimacassar-covered plush chairs of the Brown Decade.

                                                        As a child she lived within the inner circle of New York society that always thought of itself as spelled with a capital S. In her ancestry was a long succession of important names. The Schermerhorns, the Joneses, Pendletons, Stevenses, Ledyards, Rhinelanders
                                                        and Gallatins, who had led the social life of New York before Mrs. Astor&apos;s horse was a symbol, before Commodore from Staten Island, or men with strange new names from the West had descended
                                                        on the town. Her own father, although not overly rich, was, nevertheless, able to live, as she said, &quot;a life of leisure and amiable hospitality.&quot;

When little Edith walked on the Avenue she passed nothing but brownstone and the cow pasture of the Misses Kennedy. When she went on Bailey&apos;s Beach she shielded her fair skin from
                                                        the sun with a black veil. When she went to Europe it was an escape from the crudities of American society--even that with a capital S. Innocence was the life of her childhood and it was the stuff
                                                        of her better books.

                                                        Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones on Jan. 24, 1862. Her father was George Frederick Jones; her mother was the former Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, and back of each were Colonial and Revolutionary ancestors. When she was 4 the family went abroad
                                                        in pursuit of culture, health and economy, for her father&apos;s inherited funds had not increased during the Civil War that was just ended.

                                                        Her early impressions were the international--New York and Newport, Rome, Paris and Madrid. Added to this was a vivid imagination, which found outlet in story telling even before she could read. In keeping with the sheltered life of the time, she was
                                                        never sent to school, but was taught at home. She began writing short stories in her early teens, but they were never about &quot;real people.&quot; Little happened to the real people she knew; what
                                                        did &quot;happen&quot; was generally not talked about.

                                                        It was from this background that Mrs. Wharton was to inherit the belief from which she never departed, that &quot;any one gifted with the least creative faculty knows the absurdity of such a charge&quot; as that of &quot;putting flesh-and-blood people
                                                        into books.&quot; Later critics were to say that in this was her greatest lack.

                                                        The young author wrote her first efforts on brown paper salvaged from parcels. She was not encouraged. &quot;In the eyes of our provincial society,&quot; she was later to say, &quot;authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a
                                                        form of manual labor.&quot; Each was equally despised in her social level. Her first acceptance was three poems which she sent to the editor with her calling card attached.

Wrote a Novel at 11</b>

Her first novel, written when she as 11, began: &quot;&apos;Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Brown?&apos; said Mrs. Tompkins. &apos;If only I had known

                                                        Her first published book was a collaboration called &quot;The Decoration of Homes.&quot; How many short stories she wrote before 1899 is not know. But she was encouraged in her writing by such friends as Egerton Winthrop and Walter Berry and somehow,
                                                        while abroad, met Paul Bourget, the &quot;chronicler of the bourgeoisie.&quot; Other mentors were William Brownell and Edward Burlingame, for many years editor of Scribner&apos;s Magazine. In her
                                                        autobiography she writes: &quot;I do not think I have ever forgotten one word of the counsels they gave me.&quot; To which a well- known critic added, &quot;One well believes it.&quot;

She was always his respectful disciple and, although in their many meetings he disguised the severity of his judgments with his usual elaborate verbal courtesies, he managed
                                                        to convey the meaning of his criticism. He remained her close friend until his death.

                                                        This volume did not make her a wide reputation overnight. In fact, it was not until 1905 that she gained a large public, although in the interim there had appeared these books: &quot;The Touchstone,&quot;
                                                        &quot;Crucial Instances,&quot; &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Man and Other Stories,&quot; and her flare for travel books had asserted itself in two volumes on Italy,

                                                        In 1905 she published her first of many best-sellers, &quot;The House of Mirth.&quot; Most critics do not consider this her greatest book, but its popularity established her as a writer. This was in reality her first novel, although she had written long
                                                        short stories in her other books. Its title came from the biblical assertion, &quot;The heart of fools is in the House of Mirth,&quot; and it was a happy title for projecting, as Wilbur Cross once
                                                        put it, &quot;a group of pleasure-loving New Yorkers, mostly as dull as they are immoral, and letting them play out their drama unmolested by others.&quot;

                                                        Other novels came in rapid succession, but none attracted the attention in this country that was reserved for the book Elmer Davis once called &quot;the last great American love story&quot;--&quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; Those which had gone between were &quot;Madame
                                                        de Treymes,&quot; in which certain French critics detected the influence of Flaubert and Maupassant; &quot;The Fruit of the Tree,&quot; &quot;The Hermit and the Wild Woman&quot; and &quot;Artemis
                                                        to Actaeon.&quot;

In it she most successfully blended the psychological refinements she had learned from Henry James with her own inimitable ability to tell a story with
                                                        a beginning and an end. One critic has said it is comparable only to the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne as a tragedy of New England life. A novelette, it is considered a masterpiece of love and frustration,
                                                        and is likely to stand, despite its comparative brevity, as her most accomplished work.

                                                        Until 1906 Mrs. Wharton had divided her time between New York and her Summer home at Lenox, Mass. In that year she went to live in France, in Summer at Saint Brice and in Winter at Hyeres in Provence.

                                                        When the World War broke out she was in Paris and she plunged at once into relief work, opening a room for skilled women of the quarter where she lived who were thrown out of employment by the closing of workrooms. She also fed and housed 600 Belgian
                                                        refugee orphans. In recognition France awarded her the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Belgium made her a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold. Meanwhile she wrote stories and articles on the war,
                                                        including &quot;Fighting France&quot; and &quot;The Marne.&quot; After the war she visited Africa with General Lyautey at the invitation of the French Government, and wrote as a result &quot;In Morocco.&quot;

Here she used actually the materials she had hitherto used only for background--the social life of the New York into which she had been born and in which she
                                                        was bread.

It showed Mrs. Wharton at her best, understanding the cramped society of her youth, unaware of the world beyond it. Four years later she followed it with
                                                        four novelettes published under the title of &quot;Old New York,&quot; a constricted panorama of society in the Forties, Fifties, Sixties and Seventies respectively.

Then she returned to America, to be awarded the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the first woman to be so honored. In 1924 she also became
                                                        the first woman to be awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Yale University. In 1930 she was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Four years later she was elected
                                                        to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

                                                        Since that time she had written other books, including &quot;Twilight Sleep,&quot; a story of fashionable life in modern New York; &quot;The Children,&quot; a study of the children of expatriated divorcees; &quot;Hudson River Bracketed,&quot; a study
                                                        of a modern writer, and &quot;Certain People,&quot; a collection of short stories.

                                                        That generation which knew her best for &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; flocked to see &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; when it was adapted for the stage by Owen Davis and his son, Donald. Presented on Broadway with Pauline Lord, Ruth Gordon and Raymond Massey
                                                        in the leading roles, the grim tragedy proved to be as good theatre as it had previously been a great book.

                                                        Old Maid&quot; of the theatre, in which Judith Anderson and Helen Menken starred in 1935.
