                                                        Dr. John Dewey, the philosopher from whose teachings has grown the school of progressive education and &quot;learning by doing,&quot; died of pneumonia in his home, 1158 Fifth Avenue, at 7 o&apos;clock last night. He was 92 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His wife, the former Mrs. Roberta Lowit Grant, who was with him when he died, said he had been ill for twenty-six hours. He had broken a hip last November, and had been confined to the apartment, except for occasional trips to the roof for sunning.
                                                    </p>

                                                        The widow said Dr. Dewey had been carrying on various projects at home to the last, and had outlined several works. She had no idea how near to possible publication any of them might be.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Surviving also are two adopted children, Adrienne, 12, and John, 9. Five other children of his first marriage also survive--Frederick A. Dewey of New York, Mrs. Evelyn Smith of Kansas City, Mo.; Mrs. Lucy A. Brandaur of Syracuse, N.Y.; Miss Jane U. Dewey
                                                        of Baltimore and Sabino L. Dewey of Huntington, L.I., the last also having been adopted.

                                                        As a philosopher--and he was acknowledged by many as America&apos;s foremost philosopher of his time--Dr. Dewey was not content to bring forth theories; he came forward to emphasize his ideas of liberalism, and, with the courage of a crusader, was willing
                                                        to lend his name and reputation to causes that were frowned upon by staid society.

                                                        He was too big a man to be sneered at as an &quot;armchair Bolshevist.&quot; His convictions were those of an essentially honest man, and although he might well have sat back to criticize the general order of things, he took an active part in the attempt
                                                        to create a third political party, to lend his voice and influence to help the down-trodden, to do away with oppression in this country and elsewhere, and to strive for a finer universal education.

Some of his plans were quixotic and much too good for this world, but he never wavered in a cause that he considered just and he commanded the respect of all
                                                        who opposed him.

He visited Russia, China and Turkey; saw for himself, and maintained his views in the face
                                                        of public opinion in this country. He condemned hasty judgment of the affairs of other peoples and pointed to the flaws at home in no uncertain terms.</p>

                                                        Dr. Dewey had become attached to liberalism in his student days at the University of Vermont and at Johns Hopkins, where he came under the influence of Coleridge, Emerson and T. H. Green, but what finally emancipated him from the cumbersome and academic
                                                        systems of transcendentalism was his discovery in 1891 of William James&apos; &quot;Psychology.&quot; In this work, according to Prof. Herbert W. Schneider of Columbia, he not only found the &quot;instrumental
                                                        theory of concepts&quot; on which Dewey&apos;s logic was based, but also experienced that contagious mental &quot;loosening up&quot; with which James influenced his generation and which made him
                                                        the father of American philosophy.

Noted for Educational Reform

                                                        Dr. Dewey&apos;s principal achievement was perhaps his educational reform. He was the chief prophet of progressive education. After twenty years that movement--&quot;learning by doing&quot;--had become a major factor in American education in the late
                                                        Thirties, and in 1941 the New York State Department of Education approved a six-year experiment in schools embodying the Dewey philosophy.

                                                        But progressive education was long the center of controversy among educators, and in the early Forties criticism was becoming more outspoken. The revolt against Dewey and pragmatism in education was strongest in Chicago, the scene of his first and greatest
                                                        triumphs. At the University of Chicago, where Dr. Dewey was head of the Department of Philosophy and for two years director of the School of Education, President Robert Hutchins has sponsored a system
                                                        of &quot;education for freedom&quot; which seeks to separate the teaching of the &quot;intellectual&quot; from the &quot;practical&quot; arts. Both Dr. Hutchins and Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, long
                                                        president of Columbia University, sharply attacked progressive education in 1944.

                                                        undisciplined youth.

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;President Hutchins calls for liberal education of a small, elite group and vocational education for the masses. I cannot think of any idea more completely reactionary and more fatal to the whole democratic outlook.&quot;</p>

                                                        in this case does it become truly a preparation for later life is not the paradox it seems. An activity which does not have worth enough to be carried on for its own sake cannot be very effective
                                                        as a preparation for something else if the new spirit in education forms the habit of requiring that every act be an outlet of the whole self, and it provides the instruments of such complete functioning.&quot;

                                                        Later in life Professor Dewey devoted much time and thought to reform of government. He declared that the &quot;control of government must be redeemed from the special interests which have usurped it and restored to the people.&quot; Unless this were
                                                        done, he warned, political democracy would be doomed.

His father was a merchant who traced his ancestry to 1640. His mother was the daughter of a prosperous Vermont farmer of Cape Cod ancestry.

                                                        Civil Liberties Union and was chairman of the League for Independent Political Action. One of the articles of Professor Dewey&apos;s political creed was &quot;vote for the man rather than for the
                                                        party.&quot; His faith was embodied in articles that he wrote for The New Republic, Philosophical Review, Journal of Philosophy, Monist and International Journal of Ethics.

                                                        In 1919 Dr. Dewey delivered a series of lectures at the Imperial University at Tokyo. These were later published as &quot;Reconstruction in Philosophy.&quot; That same year he was invited by former Chinese students in this country to lecture in China
                                                        on the subjects of education and philosophy. He stayed in China for two years, making his headquarters at Peiping, but he traveled through all the provinces from Mukden to Canton.

                                                        Dr. Dewey went to Turkey in 1924 to make a report on the new republican government schools. In 1926 he was in Mexico, where he lectured at the Summer School of the University of Mexico. In 1928 he was one of the delegates of American educators who visited
                                                        children&apos;s institutions at Leningrad and Moscow at the invitation of the Soviet Government. Dr. Dewey was highly impressed with the educational experiments in new Russia, and voiced enthusiasm
                                                        upon his return to this country. He was somewhat criticized for his views, however, and there were some who maintained that he was naive, though his sincerity was never questioned.

                                                        In 1937 he experienced one of the stormiest episodes in his life. He went to Mexico as the head of a commission to investigate the validity of charges made by the Soviet Government against Leon Trotsky, who was living in Mexico. Trotsky had been sentenced
                                                        to death by a Russian court for plotting to overthrow the Moscow Government, but Dr. Dewey insisted that Trotsky never had a chance to defend himself.

                                                        An avowed anti-Communist, Dr. Dewey had his views as to the ideal balance between the State and the individual. What was needed, he explained, was an authority capable of directing and utilizing changes for a kind of individual freedom unlike that which
                                                        the unconstrained economic liberty had produced and justified.

Democracy, he maintained, &quot;cannot go forward unless the intelligence
                                                        of the mass of people is educated to understand the social realities of their own time.&quot;

                                                        Professor Dewey constantly urged the cultivation of independent thinking, and he deplored what he termed the &quot;empty imitation&quot; in this country of thought in Europe. He was often heard in public debate on matters of social or political significance,
                                                        and he cheerfully agreed to act as chairman whenever he thought something of consequence might result from such disputations.

                                                        As early as 1933 Dr. Dewey voiced his fear of what the future might bring if Hitler remained unchecked in Germany. Just before he sailed for Europe that year he predicted that Hitler would be headed for war as soon as he felt strong enough. A year later
                                                        he asserted that Hitler and Hitlerism were &quot;by all odds the greatest threat to world peace today.&quot; In 1936 he was one of a group of eighteen philosophers who refused to participate in the
                                                        celebration of a philosophical institution in Berlin. At that time he also was wary of Japan, warning that a secret agreement existed between Japan and Germany.</p>

The Chinese Government conferred on him the Order of the Jade for the contributions he had made to

In 1936 he was a leader in the movement to obtain a new city charter. He was active in organizations such as the New York Teachers Guild, the League for Industrial

He was a scholar who ventured to descend into the maelstrom of political strife and who took his blows, unfair as they were in many cases, with a smile and a shrug of the shoulder. But he was persistent
                                                        and his enthusiasm was infectious.

He has in the minds of many changed almost our whole conception of what philosophy is, delivering us from the old puzzles that
                                                        have formed the stock in trade of the traditional philosophy. He is chiefly responsible for our thinking of intelligence as primarily instrumental. His philosophy has common sense, acceptability
                                                        and a social bearing which distinguishes it in degree from all other philosophies.&quot;

                                                        shouted, and whose formally stated philosophy often is a stiff dose for more subtle minds. One thinks of him as refining into gold the rough ore of our tumultuous pioneer experience. He is yankeeism
                                                        at its best--shrewd, wise, humane.&quot;

                                                        Dr. Dewey married twice. In 1886, Alice Chipman, one of his students at the University of Michigan, became his bride. There were born to them six children, two of whom died in childhood. A seventh child was adopted. Mrs. Dewey died in 1927.

                                                        When he was 87, the philosopher married Mrs. Grant, a widow who lived in San Francisco, on December 11, 1946. Not quite half his age, Mrs. Grant came from an Oil City, Pa., glass manufacturing family which had been friends with Dr. Dewey before she was

Dr. Dewey had arranged years before to turn over the bulk of his assets to his first wife and their children, and after his second marriage the Deweys lived largely on his
