                                                    <h5>By RICHARD F. SHEPARD</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In more than 200 films made over 50 years, John Wayne saddled up to become the greatest figure of one of America&apos;s greatest native art forms, the western.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The movies he starred in rode the range from out-of-the-money sagebrush quickies to such classics as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; and &quot;Red River.&quot; He won an Oscar as best actor for another western, &quot;True Grit,&quot; in 1969. Yet some of the best
                                                        films he made told stories far from the wilds of the West, such as &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; and &quot;The Long Voyage Home.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the last decades of his career, Mr. Wayne became something of an American folk figure, hero to some, villain to others, for his outspoken views. He was politically a conservative and, although he scorned politics as a way of life for himself, he enthusiastically
                                                        supported Richard M. Nixon, Barry Goldwater, Spiro T. Agnew, Ronald Reagan and others who, he felt, fought for his concept of Americanism and anti- Communism.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But it was for millions of moviegoers who saw him only on the big screen that John Wayne really existed. He had not created the western with its clear-cut conflict between good and bad, right and wrong, but it was impossible to mention the word &quot;western&quot;
                                                        without thinking of &quot;the Duke,&quot; as he was called.

Film critics were lavish in praise of him in some roles and shrugged wearily as they candled his less notable efforts; one critic,
                                                        apparently overexposed to westerns, angered him by commenting, &quot;It never Waynes, but it pours.&quot;

The movie was assailed by many major critics on all grounds, political and esthetic, but the public apparently did not
                                                        mind; in only six months, it had earned $1 million above its production cost of $7 million.

Abbie Hoffman, the radical of the 1960&apos;s, paid tribute to Mr. Wayne&apos;s singularity.
                                                        Reviewing &quot;The Cowboys,&quot; made in 1972, Vincent Canby, film critic of The New York Times, who did not particularly care for it, wrote, &quot;Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible,
                                                        and he has become an almost perfect father figure.&quot;

                                                        But years before he became anything close to a father figure, Mr. Wayne had become a symbolic male figure, a man of impregnable virility and the embodiment of simplistic, laconic virtues, packaged in a well-built, 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pound frame.

He was laconic on screen. And when he shambled into view,
                                                        one could sense the arrival of coiled vigor awaiting only provocation to be sprung. His demeanor and his roles were those of a man who did not look for trouble but was relentless in tackling it when
                                                        it affronted him. This screen presence emerged particularly under the ministrations of John Ford and Howard Hawks, the directors.

                                                        Appearances were not altogether deceiving. Mr. Wayne loved adventure and the outdoors. He did believe that things were either right or wrong, and he came back against great odds. In 1964, a malignant tumor was removed from his chest and left lung, and
                                                        within several months he was on location making another movie.

He did not mind. Although his basic views had not moderated,
                                                        his tolerance, it seemed, had. He had even shown up at a function to congratulate Jane Fonda, who was to the left what he was to the right, on winning a screen award.

                                                        fans with little change in style or personality. He had consciously adapted his posture for that first movie and retained it. He was sometimes inseparable from it in the flesh.

But the Wayne saga actually started much farther east, in the small town of Winterset, Iowa, where he was born May 26, 1907, and was named
                                                        Marion Michael Morrison.

Morrison, had a drugstore, but when Marion was 6 years old, his father, because of ill health, moved the family to Southern California and became a homesteader with an 80-acre farm. Not long after, the family settled in Glendale,
                                                        where Mr. Morrison again went opened a pharmacy. His store was in the same building as a theater, and young Marion, who rose at 4 A.M. to deliver newspapers and then, after school and football practice,
                                                        delivered orders from the store, went to the movies four or five times a week, free.

In Glendale, he saw movies being made at the Triangle Studios, where they often shot outdoor scenes. The link between horse and camera was yet to be forged, but the influences
                                                        were there from the beginning. Along the way he had acquired the nickname &quot;Duke.&quot; It came from an Airedale terrier he had had, he used to say as he debunked press releases that tried to
                                                        explain the moniker as some sort of rubbed-off nobility.

                                                        By the late 1940&apos;s, Mr. Wayne had already been transformed from a dashing young adventurer to an older one, no less dashing, but in a somewhat more restrained tempo. In &quot;Red River,&quot; directed by Mr. Hawks, Mr. Wayne portrayed a ruthless
                                                        cattle baron, not altogether a good guy, but one with some depth to him. In this instance, Montgomery Clift, the co-star, represented the forces for good.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Wayne invested $1.2 million in 1960 to make &quot;The Alamo,&quot; about the fight between the Americans--the good guys--and the Mexicans--the bad guys. He played Davy Crockett. The picture was very dear to his heart because, he said, &quot;We wanted
                                                        to re-create a moment in history that will show this generation of Americans what their country still stands for. . .what some of their forebears went through to win what they had to have or die--liberty
                                                        and freedom.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was bitterly disappointed when the film failed. However, he quickly went on to other work: &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,&quot; &quot;Hatari&quot; and &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; all in 1962; &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; in 1963, and
                                                        &quot;El Dorado&quot; in 1967, another film directed by Mr. Hawks.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1969, Mr. Wayne was almost universally hailed when he starred in &quot;True Grit,&quot; directed by Henry Hathaway. Mr. Wayne played a disreputable, one-eyed, drunken, fat old man who was a Federal Marshal called Rooster Cogburn. In 1970, the Academy
                                                        of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded him an Oscar for his portrayal.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The success of &quot;True Grit&quot; led to &quot;Rooster Cogburn,&quot; in 1975, in which he co-starred with Katherine Hepburn in her first western.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Wayne starred in his first television special, &quot;Swing Out, Sweet Land,&quot; a paean of patriotism, in 1970, and later became well-known for various television appearances. He never made a television series and had deep reservations about the
                                                        medium&apos;s approach to the western.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Television has a tendency to reach a little,&quot; he observed, referring to television westerns&apos; propensities for psychological insights. &quot;In their westerns, they are getting away from the simplicity and the fact that those men were fighting
                                                        the elements and the rawness of nature and didn&apos;t have time for this couch-work.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His anti-Communist sentiments led Mr. Wayne to help found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in 1944, and he was its president for two terms.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The organization, which eventually disbanded, was accused of having given the names of suspected Communists in the film industry to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, although Mr. Wayne said later that he had never been party to any such thing.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Once, interviewed about civil rights, he said: &quot;I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to the point of responsibility. I don&apos;t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He said that when he was in school, he was a &quot;socialist,&quot; but not for long. He said that he was a rebel, but not one like the youngsters of the late 60&apos;s.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Mine is a rebellion against the monotony of life,&quot; he said. &quot;The rebellion in these kids-- particularly the S.D.S.&apos;ers and those groups--seems to be a kind of dissension by rote.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In his later years, Mr. Wayne, who had invested in oil and also in a shrimp business in Panama, among other things, became more financially conservative than he had been. He had not kept a very tight hand on his money earlier, and at one point realized
                                                        he was not as well off as he had thought.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        However, he was not impoverished. He lived with his third wife, Pilar Palette Wayne, who was born in Peru, in an 11-room, seven-bathroom, $175,000 house in Newport Beach, Calif., where he had a 135-foot yacht. He owned cattle ranches in Stanfield and
                                                        Springerville, Ariz.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Wayne&apos;s first two marriages, to Josephine Saenz and Esperanzo Bauer, also Latin Americans, ended in divorces. He had seven children from his marriages, and more than 15 grandchildren. </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        In more than 200 films made over 50 years, John Wayne saddled up to become the greatest figure of one of America&apos;s greatest native art forms, the western.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The movies he starred in rode the range from out-of-the-money sagebrush quickies to such classics as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; and &quot;Red River.&quot; He won an Oscar as best actor for another western, &quot;True Grit,&quot; in 1969. Yet some of the best
                                                        films he made told stories far from the wilds of the West, such as &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; and &quot;The Long Voyage Home.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the last decades of his career, Mr. Wayne became something of an American folk figure, hero to some, villain to others, for his outspoken views. He was politically a conservative and, although he scorned politics as a way of life for himself, he enthusiastically
                                                        supported Richard M. Nixon, Barry Goldwater, Spiro T. Agnew, Ronald Reagan and others who, he felt, fought for his concept of Americanism and anti- Communism.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But it was for millions of moviegoers who saw him only on the big screen that John Wayne really existed. He had not created the western with its clear-cut conflict between good and bad, right and wrong, but it was impossible to mention the word &quot;western&quot;
                                                        without thinking of &quot;the Duke,&quot; as he was called.

                                                    <p>
                                                        By the early 1960&apos;s, 161 of his films had grossed $350 million, and he had been paid as much as $666,000 to make a movie--although in his early days on screen, his salary ran to no more than two or three figures a week.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was rarely a simple matter to find a unanimous opinion on Mr. Wayne, whether it had to do with his acting or his politics. Film critics were lavish in praise of him in some roles and shrugged wearily as they candled his less notable efforts; one critic,
                                                        apparently overexposed to westerns, angered him by commenting, &quot;It never Waynes, but it pours.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Wayne was co-director and star of &quot;The Green Berets,&quot; a 1968 film that supported the United States action in Vietnam. The movie was assailed by many major critics on all grounds, political and esthetic, but the public apparently did not
                                                        mind; in only six months, it had earned $1 million above its production cost of $7 million.

Won Growing Respect</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As the years passed, Mr. Wayne was recognized as some sort of American natural resource, and his various critics, political and film, looked on him with more respect. Abbie Hoffman, the radical of the 1960&apos;s, paid tribute to Mr. Wayne&apos;s singularity.
                                                        Reviewing &quot;The Cowboys,&quot; made in 1972, Vincent Canby, film critic of The New York Times, who did not particularly care for it, wrote, &quot;Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible,
                                                        and he has become an almost perfect father figure.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But years before he became anything close to a father figure, Mr. Wayne had become a symbolic male figure, a man of impregnable virility and the embodiment of simplistic, laconic virtues, packaged in a well-built, 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pound frame.
                                                    </p>

                                                        He had a handsome and hearty face, with crinkles around eyes that were too lidded to express much emotion but gave the impression of a man of action, an outdoor man who chafed at a settled life. He was laconic on screen. And when he shambled into view,
                                                        one could sense the arrival of coiled vigor awaiting only provocation to be sprung. His demeanor and his roles were those of a man who did not look for trouble but was relentless in tackling it when
                                                        it affronted him. This screen presence emerged particularly under the ministrations of John Ford and Howard Hawks, the directors.

                                                        Appearances were not altogether deceiving. Mr. Wayne loved adventure and the outdoors. He did believe that things were either right or wrong, and he came back against great odds. In 1964, a malignant tumor was removed from his chest and left lung, and
                                                        within several months he was on location making another movie.

He did not mind. Although his basic views had not moderated,
                                                        his tolerance, it seemed, had. He had even shown up at a function to congratulate Jane Fonda, who was to the left what he was to the right, on winning a screen award.

                                                        fans with little change in style or personality. He had consciously adapted his posture for that first movie and retained it. He was sometimes inseparable from it in the flesh.

I figured I needed a gimmick, so I dreamed up the drawl, the squint and a way

But the Wayne saga actually started much farther east, in the small town of Winterset, Iowa, where he was born May 26, 1907, and was named
                                                        Marion Michael Morrison.

Morrison, had a drugstore, but when Marion was 6 years old, his father, because of ill health, moved the family to Southern California and became a homesteader with an 80-acre farm. Not long after, the family settled in Glendale,
                                                        where Mr. Morrison again went opened a pharmacy. His store was in the same building as a theater, and young Marion, who rose at 4 A.M. to deliver newspapers and then, after school and football practice,
                                                        delivered orders from the store, went to the movies four or five times a week, free.

In Glendale, he saw movies being made at the Triangle Studios, where they often shot outdoor scenes. The link between horse and camera was yet to be forged, but the influences
                                                        were there from the beginning. Along the way he had acquired the nickname &quot;Duke.&quot; It came from an Airedale terrier he had had, he used to say as he debunked press releases that tried to
                                                        explain the moniker as some sort of rubbed-off nobility.

                                                        in his second year he broke an ankle and dropped out.

John Ford was attracted to the youth&apos;s hulking physique and made him a &quot;fourth-assistant prop boy.&quot; When Mr. Ford was making a submarine

When Raoul Walsh cast him as the star of &quot;The Big Trail,&quot; his expensive, $2 million western, the director thought that Marion was
                                                        too sissified a name for a western hero, and &quot;John Wayne&quot; was born.

In &quot;Red River,&quot; directed by Mr. Hawks, Mr. Wayne portrayed a ruthless

He played Davy Crockett. The picture was very dear to his heart because, he said, &quot;We wanted
                                                        to re-create a moment in history that will show this generation of Americans what their country still stands for. . .what some of their forebears went through to win what they had to have or die--liberty

                                                        &quot;Television has a tendency to reach a little,&quot; he observed, referring to television westerns&apos; propensities for psychological insights. &quot;In their westerns, they are getting away from the simplicity and the fact that those men were fighting
                                                        the elements and the rawness of nature and didn&apos;t have time for this couch-work.&quot;

                                                        His anti-Communist sentiments led Mr. Wayne to help found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in 1944, and he was its president for two terms.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The organization, which eventually disbanded, was accused of having given the names of suspected Communists in the film industry to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, although Mr. Wayne said later that he had never been party to any such thing.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Once, interviewed about civil rights, he said: &quot;I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to the point of responsibility. I don&apos;t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He said that when he was in school, he was a &quot;socialist,&quot; but not for long. He said that he was a rebel, but not one like the youngsters of the late 60&apos;s.
                                                    </p>

                                                        &quot;Mine is a rebellion against the monotony of life,&quot; he said. &quot;The rebellion in these kids-- particularly the S.D.S.&apos;ers and those groups--seems to be a kind of dissension by rote.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        In his later years, Mr. Wayne, who had invested in oil and also in a shrimp business in Panama, among other things, became more financially conservative than he had been. He had not kept a very tight hand on his money earlier, and at one point realized
                                                        he was not as well off as he had thought.

                                                        However, he was not impoverished. He lived with his third wife, Pilar Palette Wayne, who was born in Peru, in an 11-room, seven-bathroom, $175,000 house in Newport Beach, Calif., where he had a 135-foot yacht. He owned cattle ranches in Stanfield and

                                                    <p>Mr. Wayne&apos;s first two marriages, to Josephine Saenz and Esperanzo Bauer, also Latin Americans, ended in divorces. He had seven children from his marriages, and more than 15 grandchildren. </p>
