                                                    <h5>By EDWARD A. GARGAN</h5>
                                                    <p>Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine short-story writer, poet and essayist who was considered one of Latin America&apos;s greatest writers, died yesterday in Geneva, where he had been living for three months.
                                                        He was 86 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Borges died of liver cancer, the executor of his estate, Osvaldo Luis Vidaurre, said in Buenos Aires.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        While almost unknown outside Argentina before 1961, his stories, punctilious in their language and mysterious in their opaque parodoxes, later attained a modest following in the United States, a following that grew steadily to international proportions.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His writings explored the crannies of the human psyche, the fantastic within the apparently mundane, imaginary bestiaries and fables of obscure libraries and arcane scholarship.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His prose provoked the literary imaginations of general readers, scholars and critics, and many hailed him as the most important Latin American writer of this century.

In the story, written in 1938, Mr. Borges proposed, in short,
                                                        an extreme examination of T. S. Eliot&apos;s dictum that each new work of art alters the perception of previously existing works of art.

Once he wrote: &apos;&apos;In the course of a lifetime devoted

                                                        Jorge Luis Borges was born in Buenos Aires, in the house of his maternal grandparents, on Aug. 24, 1899. His father, of Italian, Jewish and English heritage, professed the law but, as Mr. Borges once wrote, &apos;&apos;was a philosophical anarchist -
                                                        a disciple of Spencer -and also a teacher of psychology.&apos;&apos; His mother, of Argentine and Uruguayan stock, lived far into her 90&apos;s and translated William Saroyan, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
                                                        Virginia Woolf and Herman Melville into Spanish.

                                                        While he was very young, his parents moved to the northern suburbs of the capital, to Palermo, a place he later described as a slum. But it was not, he wrote, a slum in the American sense. It was, rather, a district where &apos;&apos;shabby-genteel people
                                                        as well as more undesirable sorts&apos;&apos; lived.

                                                        At the age of 6 or 7, the young Borges began to write. &apos;&apos;I was expected to be a writer,&apos;&apos; he recalled much later in life. He confessed that his first writing was modeled on classic Spanish writers, mostly Cervantes. The young man&apos;s
                                                        first effort, &apos;&apos;The Fatal Helmet,&apos;&apos; was avowedly romantic - &apos;&apos;nonsensical,&apos;&apos; he later called it - and very much a stylistic derivative of Cervantes. </p>
                                                    <p>In 1914 the family moved to Europe so that Jorge and his sister could attend school in Geneva. Jorge enrolled at the College of Geneva. In school, the young man was immersed in Latin, and outside it
                                                        he tackled German. He learned to love the language through Heine and found his way to Schopenhauer, who was to be his favorite.

                                                        published in Bombay. Mr. Borges invests the mythical volume with a genuine publisher and reviewer but, as he wrote later, &apos;&apos;the author and the book are entirely my own invention.&apos;&apos;

                                                        detail; footnotes; meticulous references to remote academic journals, and the presence of deliberately translucent paradox.

                                                        and to remember regular verse forms rather than free ones.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>After he shared the Formentor Prize with Samuel Beckett in 1961, Mr. Borges&apos;s books began to sell increasingly well internationally, and he was invited abroad to lecture and to take up visiting
                                                        professorships.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Over the following years he traveled extensively in the United States and Europe, lecturing and receiving bouquets of literary awards.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>And though he was perennially a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, it was denied him. It was perhaps less a concern to him than to others. After winning the prize in 1982, the Colombian novelist
                                                        Gabriel Garcia Marquez said of Mr. Borges, &apos;&apos;I hope he receives it, and I still don&apos;t understand why they haven&apos;t given it to him.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Some have insisted that it was Mr. Borges&apos;s aversion to politics, his unwillingness to criticize the repression of post-Peronist regimes - &apos;&apos;I suppose they are a necessary evil, for the
                                                        next 50 years, or so,&apos;&apos; he said - that kept him from becoming a Nobel laureate.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was, however, sympathetic to the plight of mothers whose children were victims of death squads that were tacitly or actively supported by Argentina&apos;s military Government. &apos;&apos;I had my say about the disappeared,&apos;&apos; he told an interviewer.
                                                        &apos;&apos;But what can I do? I&apos;m an old man. What can they do to me? Torture me, eh?&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <b>An Unworldly Life </b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Borges led a hermetic, unworldly life. Seemingly fragile in his last years, as he leaned on a vertebral wooden cane, he was gentlemanly in manner and locution. With blindness he relied increasingly on assistants to read to him and to write what he
                                                        dictated. Always Mr. Borges wrote and read, and perhaps it was, in the end, the latter that was paramount. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &apos;&apos;To me, reading has been a way of living,&apos;&apos; he once said. &apos;&apos;I think the only possible fate for me was a literary life. I can&apos;t think of myself in a bookless world. I need books. They mean everything to me.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        During his lecture tours, he had a particular fondness for New Orleans. When he was not writing in his hotel room there, he was listening to jazz, invariably distinguished in his suit and tie from other jazz club patrons. </p>

                                                        &apos;&apos;My father told me a gentleman never goes in public in his shirt sleeves,&apos;&apos; he said, &apos;&apos;but I think these people are right to dress comfortably when it is hot.&apos;&apos;

                                                        At the age of 68, Mr. Borges was married for the first time, to a childhood sweetheart, Elsa Astete Millan, the widow of a friend. It proved to be an unhappy episode, and they divorced three years later.

                                                    <p>
                                                        He married Maria Kodama, his 41-year-old secretary and longtime traveling companion, a few weeks ago.</p>
                                                    <b>&apos;Dreary&apos; Buenos Aires </b>
                                                    <p>In later life, Mr. Borges was not so happy as he had once been with Argentina and its capital. &apos;&apos;Buenos Aires is a dreary city now,&apos;&apos; he told an interviewer during the war with Britain
                                                        over the Falkland Islands in the spring of 1982, a war he termed &apos;&apos;atrocious.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&apos;&apos;I don&apos;t understand my own country. But the world is not meant to be understood by men. Every night, I dream. I have nightmares - of being lost, of being in an unknown city. I don&apos;t
                                                        remember the name of the hotel, or I can&apos;t find my way home in Buenos Aires. Maybe I feel very lost because the world is meaningless.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Yet Mr. Borges found meaning in his own work. At the end of his published conversations with the literary scholar Richard Burgin, Mr. Borges wrote: </p>
                                                    <p>&apos;&apos;Through the years, a man peoples a space with images of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, tools, stars, horses, and people. Shortly before his death, he
                                                        discovers that the patient labyrinth of lines traces the image of his own face.&apos;&apos;
