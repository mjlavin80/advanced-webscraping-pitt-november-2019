He achieved the highest acclaim for his exploits as a grand strategist in World War II and in Korea and then held the center stage in one of the bitterest civil

                                                        judgment, outwardly unmoved by the events that swirled about him.

He was the third of three sons born to Capt. Arthur MacArthur and his Virginia-born wife, the
                                                        former Mary Pinkney Hardy.

Chattanooga
                                                        in World War I. Arthur died of a ruptured appendix in 1923.

The MacArtairs had their seat near Glasgow, Scotland. General MacArthur&apos;s grandfather, with his widowed mother, came to this
                                                        country in 1825 and settled in Chicopee Falls, Mass. He became a lawyer.

In his memoirs to be published next fall by McGraw-Hill, he told the story of a court case presided over by his grandfather. One of the contending lawyers
                                                        appeared to have overstated his case and lost the suit. He recounted the episode to his grandson Douglas.

He rose through the ranks, won the Medal of Honor in the
                                                        Battle of Missionary Ridge in November, 1863, and was known as &quot;the boy colonel.&quot; The war over, he left the Army to study law, was recalled to the ranks and fought against the Indians in
                                                        the West. While he was on duty at fort Dodge, his third son was born.

The elder MacArthur rose to major general commanding the Army of
                                                        the Philippines, and retired as a lieutenant general.

To join the Long Gray Line had been the lodestar of all my hopes since the sound of bugles had ushered me into

Much has been written of his West Point military and academic record. In the four undergraduate years he attained a scholastic record not equaled in the previous 25 years.
                                                        He recalled that there were others in his class smarter than he, but said that his achievement resulted, perhaps, from having &quot;a somewhat clearer perspective of events--a better realization
                                                        that first things come first. Or, perhaps, it was just luck.&quot;

                                                        of his decision to remain silent on pain of dismissal.

With his father serving in the Army 10,000 miles away in that critical period of his
                                                        life, the young cadet drew from the aristocratic, forceful woman the inspiration and strength that sometimes come from both parents.

                                                        from time to time. There, for the first time, he heard shots fired in anger. And, as a prelude to many escapes in many other battlefields, he once had his hat shot off.

As a captain, he served in the expeditionary forces at

For decades rumors, neither confirmed nor denied by General MacArthur, said that General MacArthur had cast a dissenting vote. The actual vote was never disclosed.

                                                        was simplicity itself. Almost ostentatiously, he wore no ribbons, insignia or braid other than the tiny circlet of five stars on his right collar tabs.

                                                        As the possibility of war grew, the Philippine Army was merged with the United States Army under the command of General MacArthur, who was restored to duty with the American forces as a lieutenant general on July 27, 1941. In December he was made a full

                                                        That attack was followed on the same day by a Japanese attack on military installations in the Philippines where General MacArthur&apos;s forces were caught completely by surprise. His air arm was virtually destroyed. His air command later explained that

A hardened, well-equipped Japanese force landed on Luzon and struck toward the fortified United States military base on Bataan Peninsula into which MacArthur had drawn his forces.

Added to this force were about 100,000 partly equipped Filipinos. The Japanese rolled the American forces into the Bataan

In fact, the views of the general and those of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, United States commander in the Pacific, were to be opposed until

                                                        In a career studded with military triumphs, the greatest of these for General MacArthur came on Sept. 2, 1945, when Japanese representatives boarded the battleship U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Bay to sign the unconditional surrender documents under his gaze.
                                                    </p>

It appeared that the Japanese representative intended to read the surrender document before signing
                                                        it.

                                                        A few years later General MacArthur assayed his role as Supreme Commander of the Occupation of Japan as follows:

                                                        sacred duty it became, once the guns were silenced, to carry to the land of our vanquished foe the solace and hope and faith of Christian morals.

                                                        The occupation of a proud nation, prostrate, bewildered and hated, was to prove a phenomenon in the history of defeat and conquest.

                                                        The remnants of its military establishment were dismantled. Its military leaders were imprisoned, tried and punished as war criminals. Its vast industrial complex was in ruins and its people were fearful and uncertain of the future. In swift strokes,
                                                        the occupation stripped the Emperor of his divinity, dismantled the Zaibatsu (an informal but all-powerful industrial hierarchy based on family ties) and instituted reforms that shook the roots of
                                                        an ancient class society.

                                                        Sitting remotely and serenely atop the occupation was the architect of the defeat of the Japanese, the symbol of their conquest, whose power over them exceeded that of the now powerless Emperor. Rightly or wrongly, this was the Japanese view of General
                                                        MacArthur in September, 1945.

                                                        With the beginning of the occupation of Japan, the extent to which the Soviet Union would share it had not been decided on the highest levels. Taking advantage of this, General MacArthur rode roughshod over Soviet efforts to get a foot in the door.

                                                        It quickly became a standing joke in Tokyo that the ranking representative of the Soviet Union in Japan, Lieut. Gen. Kuzma Nikolayevich Derevyanko, spent more time in General MacArthur&apos;s outer office awaiting audiences that never took place than
                                                        anyone else in the country.

                                                        General Derevyanko, who had signed the surrender for his country aboard the Missouri, sought General MacArthur&apos;s ear for a discussion of the Soviet role in the occupation, but the Russians never obtained one. General Derevyanko went home in the first
                                                        week of October, 1945, and the occupation remained an American affair.

                                                        The occupation moved along through five years during which General MacArthur, remote but omnipresent, moved between his office in the downtown Dai Ichi Building and his residence in the sprawling, white stone-and-concrete United States Embassy.

                                                        Thousands of Japanese lined the streets and sidewalks to watch him pass in a long, black car four times a day. All precedent was shattered and Japanese traditionalists were appalled when, early in the occupation, the Emperor called on him at his home.
                                                        The Tenno (Emperor), believed by Japanese to be a descendant of the Sun Goddess, went, as did many others of high station from many nations, to pay his respects to the American general.

                                                        The serenity of Asia was shattered at dawn on the morning of June 25, 1950, when North Korean troops who had been trained and equipped by Russians swept southward across the 38th parallel in a lightning effort to overwhelm the inadequate South Korean
                                                        forces, who were being trained under the direction of a United States military advisory team of fewer than 1,000 men and officers.

                                                        President Truman ordered General MacArthur to take whatever steps he thought necessary to evacuate the Americans from South Korea. The civilians were evacuated by sea and air. The advisory troops remained with the Korean units.

                                                        Then General MacArthur informed Gen. Lawton Collins, Chief of Staff, that the South Koreans, in all probability could not defend themselves successfully. In Washington decisions were being made hourly as a result of which the United States became, step

President Truman decided to act on General MacArthur&apos;s recommendation to send United States troops in Japan and
                                                        Okinawa into the struggle to stem the Communist tide.

Since the Soviet Union was at that moment boycotting the Security Council for other reasons and was not present to use its veto, the United Nations decided
                                                        to join forces with the South Koreans and the United States in the struggle.

                                                        Near the end of September, mopping-up operations of North Korean Communist forces south of the 38th parallel continued while some United Nations units, their areas cleared of the enemy, marked time.

                                                        The taste of victory sent the enthusiasm of United Nations forces soaring. Unit commanders were in favor of pursuing the enemy northward without delay. However, orders were held in abeyance as word came that there was grave consternation at United Nations
                                                        headquarters as to whether the intent of the combined effort had been to repel the invaders or rid the entire peninsula of Communist military forces.

He came and went between office and residence with the same clockwork regularity while Japanese

                                                        On Oct. 10, President Truman flew to Wake Island for a meeting with General MacArthur. The President appeared to be concerned with the General&apos;s propensity for independent action.

                                                        At Wake Island, General MacArthur was understood to have expressed great optimism about the Korean situation. He told the President there was &quot;very little&quot; chance that the Chinese Communists or the Soviet Union would react to a venture into
                                                        North Korea.

                                                        General MacArthur returned to Tokyo and began to &quot;close out&quot; the Korean War. Near the end of October a regimental airborne combat unit was employed in the war&apos;s only paratroop operation. United States paratroopers were dropped at two points
                                                        just north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to cut off fleeing and disorganized Communist units. At the same time United Nations ground troops slashed across the 38th parallel in a dash to
                                                        the Yalu River, Korea&apos;s northern boundary with China.

They had crossed the Yalu about Oct. 16. General MacArthur&apos;s intelligence

                                                    </p>

                                                        His only previous serious illness struck him in January, 1960, when he underwent surgery for a prostate condition. He recovered from the ordeal despite his 80 years.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        General MacArthur was married twice. His first marriage was to Mrs. Henrietta Louise Cromwell Brooks, the divorced wife of Walter Brooks, Jr., and stepdaughter of Edward T. Stotesbury, a wealthy Philadelphia banker. She obtained a divorced from him in
                                                        1929 on the ground that he had failed to support her.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was married to Jean Marie Faircloth, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., April 30, 1937. Their only child, Arthur, was born in Manila on Feb. 21, 1938. Arthur graduated from Columbia University in 1961.

                                                        General of the Army Douglas MacArthur served his country as a soldier for more than 60 years. He achieved the highest acclaim for his exploits as a grand strategist in World War II and in Korea and then held the center stage in one of the bitterest civil

                                                        Virtually every military honor was bestowed upon him, yet his active career ended in bitterness and recrimination when he was relieved of his command in the midst of a war by his Commander in Chief.

                                                        His life was marked by no struggle against poverty or lack of privilege. His rise to prominence was unmarred by temporary setbacks or misfortune. Even the final, discordant note of his career--his removal from command--left him serenely confident in his
                                                        judgment, outwardly unmoved by the events that swirled about him.

He was the third of three sons born to Capt. Arthur MacArthur and his Virginia-born wife, the
                                                        former Mary Pinkney Hardy.

Chattanooga
                                                        in World War I. Arthur died of a ruptured appendix in 1923.

The MacArtairs had their seat near Glasgow, Scotland. General MacArthur&apos;s grandfather, with his widowed mother, came to this

In his memoirs to be published next fall by McGraw-Hill, he told the story of a court case presided over by his grandfather. One of the contending lawyers
                                                        appeared to have overstated his case and lost the suit. He recounted the episode to his grandson Douglas.

                                                        General MacArthur&apos;s father was destined for West Point, but in August, 1862, a little more than a year after the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. He rose through the ranks, won the Medal of Honor in the
                                                        Battle of Missionary Ridge in November, 1863, and was known as &quot;the boy colonel.&quot; The war over, he left the Army to study law, was recalled to the ranks and fought against the Indians in
                                                        the West. While he was on duty at fort Dodge, his third son was born.

The elder MacArthur rose to major general commanding the Army of
                                                        the Philippines, and retired as a lieutenant general.

To join the Long Gray Line had been the lodestar of all my hopes since the sound of bugles had ushered me into

Much has been written of his West Point military and academic record. In the four undergraduate years he attained a scholastic record not equaled in the previous 25 years.
                                                        He recalled that there were others in his class smarter than he, but said that his achievement resulted, perhaps, from having &quot;a somewhat clearer perspective of events--a better realization
                                                        that first things come first. Or, perhaps, it was just luck.&quot;

                                                        Recalling a crisis in his cadet career when he was summoned to a hearing on the question of hazing at the academy and faced the challenge of being ordered to disclose the names of culprits involved, General MacArthur told of his mother&apos;s stanch support
                                                        of his decision to remain silent on pain of dismissal.

With his father serving in the Army 10,000 miles away in that critical period of his
                                                        life, the young cadet drew from the aristocratic, forceful woman the inspiration and strength that sometimes come from both parents.

                                                        from time to time. There, for the first time, he heard shots fired in anger. And, as a prelude to many escapes in many other battlefields, he once had his hat shot off.

As a captain, he served in the expeditionary forces at

On one occasion, with the capture of the French city of Sedan assigned to the French Army, he entered into competition
                                                        with the French to be first in the town.

                                                        of which forces first entered Sedan, but the French were listed officially as the first.

He became involved routinely in a lively controversy as a member of the court in the court-martial of Brig. Gen. William B. Mitchell in 1926. Billy Mitchell was an

For decades rumors, neither confirmed nor denied by General MacArthur, said that General MacArthur had cast a dissenting vote. The actual vote was never disclosed.

Resuming his permanent rank of major general, General MacArthur was sent to the Philippines as military adviser to the commonwealth.

He was the only American to hold such a rank. It was then, exercising the privileges of that exalted rank, that General MacArthur designed the

Other emoluments were provided, making it possible for him to live, as he did later in Tokyo and in the Waldorf Towers, a

His considerable investments, both in the Philippines and in this country, were the basis of frequent conjecture,
                                                        but their extent and nature were never disclosed. His mode of living after achieving top rank was such that he seldom opened a door, drove an automobile or had to perform the myriad personal tasks

Save for his battered, braid-encrusted campaign cap, his military dress
                                                        was simplicity itself. Almost ostentatiously, he wore no ribbons, insignia or braid other than the tiny circlet of five stars on his right collar tabs.

In December he was made a full

                                                        That attack was followed on the same day by a Japanese attack on military installations in the Philippines where General MacArthur&apos;s forces were caught completely by surprise. His air arm was virtually destroyed. His air command later explained that

A hardened, well-equipped Japanese force landed on Luzon and struck toward the fortified United States military base on Bataan Peninsula into which MacArthur had drawn his forces.

Added to this force were about 100,000 partly equipped Filipinos. The Japanese rolled the American forces into the Bataan

                                                        a base for the assault on Japan.

He made a strong emotional appeal, backed up by strategic arguments, that the United States was honor-bound to liberate the Philippines.

Missouri in Tokyo Bay to sign the unconditional surrender documents under his gaze.

Its vast industrial complex was in ruins and its people were fearful and uncertain of the future. In swift strokes,
                                                        the occupation stripped the Emperor of his divinity, dismantled the Zaibatsu (an informal but all-powerful industrial hierarchy based on family ties) and instituted reforms that shook the roots of

Rightly or wrongly, this was the Japanese view of General

Taking advantage of this, General MacArthur rode roughshod over Soviet efforts to get a foot in the door.

General Derevyanko went home in the first

All precedent was shattered and Japanese traditionalists were appalled when, early in the occupation, the Emperor called on him at his home.

                                                        President Truman ordered General MacArthur to take whatever steps he thought necessary to evacuate the Americans from South Korea. The civilians were evacuated by sea and air. The advisory troops remained with the Korean units.

Lawton Collins, Chief of Staff, that the South Koreans, in all probability could not defend themselves successfully. In Washington decisions were being made hourly as a result of which the United States became, step

President Truman decided to act on General MacArthur&apos;s recommendation to send United States troops in Japan and
                                                        Okinawa into the struggle to stem the Communist tide.

Since the Soviet Union was at that moment boycotting the Security Council for other reasons and was not present to use its veto, the United Nations decided
                                                        to join forces with the South Koreans and the United States in the struggle.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In the message that accompanied his order relieving General MacArthur, President Truman said:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Full and vigorous debate on matters of national policy is a vital element in the constitutional system of our free democracy. It is fundamental, however, that military commanders must be governed by the policies and directives issued to them in
                                                        the manner prescribed by our laws and Constitution. In time of crises this consideration is particularly compelling.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;General MacArthur&apos;s place in history as one of our greatest commanders is fully established. The nation owes him a debt of gratitude for the distinguished and exceptional service which he has rendered his country in posts of great responsibility.
                                                        For that reason I repeat my regret at the necessity for the action I feel compelled to take in this case.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        On April 17, the general, his wife and son arrived in San Francisco. His return was that of a conquering hero as city after city feted him with parades.

                                                        Beginning May 3 he testified for three days before the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate, insisting he could have won the Korean conflict if he had been given a free hand. He addressed the joint houses of Congress on April
                                                        19, creating a deep impression by the moderation of his speech and the dignity of its presentation.

                                                        He ended with a quotation from an old army song--&quot;Old soldiers never die--they just fade away.&quot;

                                                        He did not fade away, however. He continued to make speeches and pronouncements. His name was brought up before the 1952 Republican National Convention as a possible Presidential nominee. He was the keynote speaker, but the nomination went to General
                                                        Eisenhower.

                                                        Of the United Nations he once said:

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;It represents perhaps the noblest effort man has yet made to evolve a universal code based upon the highest of moral precepts. It became the keystone to an arch of universal hope.&quot;

                                                        General MacArthur and his wife settled in a 37th floor suite of the Waldorf Towers, high above Park Avenue. On Aug. 1, 1952, he was named chairman of the board of Remington Rand Inc. (now Sperry-Rand), manufacturers of electrical equipment and business
                                                        machines. General Whitney remained his inseparable companion and confidant.

                                                        With the death in 1959 of Gen. George C. Marshall, General MacArthur became the senior officer of the United States Army in the rank of General of the Army. He remained on active duty without assignment, entitled to a small staff and pay and allowances
                                                        amounting to $20,543 a year.

                                                        In July, 1961, General MacArthur, accompanied by his wife, made a sentimental journey to the Philippines, his only trip abroad following his return to the United States in 1951. Additional honors were bestowed upon him by the Government there.

                                                        His only previous serious illness struck him in January, 1960, when he underwent surgery for a prostate condition. He recovered from the ordeal despite his 80 years.

                                                        General MacArthur was married twice. His first marriage was to Mrs. Henrietta Louise Cromwell Brooks, the divorced wife of Walter Brooks, Jr., and stepdaughter of Edward T. Stotesbury, a wealthy Philadelphia banker. She obtained a divorced from him in
                                                        1929 on the ground that he had failed to support her.

                                                        He was married to Jean Marie Faircloth, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., April 30, 1937. Their only child, Arthur, was born in Manila on Feb. 21, 1938. Arthur graduated from Columbia University in 1961.
