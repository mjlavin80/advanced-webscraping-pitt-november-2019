                                                    <h5>By ALDEN WHITMAN</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the most durable, canny and empirical of modern dictators, Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teodulo Franco y Bahamonde became master of Spain as a result of a military conspiracy, a dash of luck, timely help from foreign corporations, the influence
                                                        of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and crucial armed assistance from Hitler and Mussolini.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He became dictator in 1939 in the culmination of a three-year civil war. He was aided in winning the war by the internal weaknesses of the incumbent Government, principally its inability to achieve political unity among its disparate parties and factions.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although the Government put up a valiant defense, it had fatal difficulty in buying arms abroad. Its armed forces, moreover, were beset by the same sort of disunity that hobbled the Cabinet.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At the close of his long and sternly authoritarian rule, Generalissimo Franco could look back on 36 years of an imposed stability that rested on a policy of suppression of fundamental democratic rights. But it was also a stability that gave Spain a rising

5 Terrorists Executed

                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the last such episodes, which revealed an increasing impatience with Franco, occurred in September, 1975, when five convicted terrorists were executed despite protests from most of Western Europe and appeals for clemency from Pope Paul VI. The
                                                        Vatican statement symbolized an about-face for the church, which for most of Franco&apos;s years had endorsed his policies. In the last five years, however, the church had been increasingly murmurous

                                                        The incident pointed up, moreover, a crumbling of support for Franco among some of his hitherto strong supporters. The church, members of the Falange, monarchists and the financial-industrial community were all restive for an orderly transfer of power
                                                        from the hands of an aging ruler.

Then, by clever diplomacy, he took Spain through World War II as a nonbelligerent while averring
                                                        his attachment to the Fascist powers. Exercising patience, he waited out years of international ostracism after the war, from which he was rescued by a United States decision in 1950 to acquire military
                                                        bases in the country as a move in the cold war with the Soviet Union.

                                                        Now esteemed by the West, he was able in 1955 to have his nation admitted to the United Nations, which had expressly barred Spain in 1946 in a resolution asserting that &quot;in origin, nature, structure and general conduct, the Franco regime is a Fascist
                                                        regime patterned on, and established largely as a result of aid received from Hitler&apos;s Nazi Germany and Mussolini&apos;s Fascist Italy.&quot;

                                                        After his diplomatic resurrection, Franco began to loosen the rigors of dictatorship. Foreign investment was encouraged, tourism was promoted, wage levels inched upward. By 1962 per capita income for the nation&apos;s 33 million people reached $300 a
                                                        year and then quadrupled by 1972.

                                                        Most authoritarian restrictions remained. There was no press freedom; no trade unions were permitted; only one political party was allowed; the armed forces were omnipresent.

He was thus the indispensable

The changes displaced the Falange as a powerful political force.
                                                        The Falange, which had earlier been absorbed into the National Movement was Franco&apos;s mass bulwark in the Civil War and afterward.</p>

Luis Carrero Blanco, as Premier. His uneasy regime came to a violent end in December, 1973, when he was assassinated in an ambush attributed
                                                        to Basque separatists. Evincing renewed firmness, Franco named Carlos Arias Navarro, the Interior Minister, as Premier.

Part of Franco&apos;s problem was that Spain&apos;s relative economic boom engendered a libertarian backlash. Tourism brought in not only vital
                                                        foreign exchange but also tourists who personified the rewards of the democratic countries from which they came. In addition, almost a million Spaniards went abroad to work in the sixties. They sent
                                                        home cash and brought home rudimentary ideas of democratic freedoms and worker-controlled trade unions.

Product of 19th Century

                                                        Franco was very much the product of 19th-century Spain and the tradition that sons of military officers should follow the father&apos;s profession. He was born Dec. 4, 1892, at El Ferrol, on the Galician coast, the son of Nicolas Franco, a naval officer,
                                                        and Pilar Bahamonde Franco. It is widely believed, although skirted officially, that Sephardic Jews were among his ancestors.

                                                        Franco was ticketed for a naval career, but, because of the loss of the navy in the Spanish- American War, there were no examinations for the Academia de Marina in 1907. So instead he entered the Academia de Infanteria in Toledo, from which he was commissioned
                                                        a second lieutenant in the army in 1910.

He developed a reputation for personal valor, for exacting discipline
                                                        and for excellence as an organizer. He was deputy commander of the Spanish Foreign Legion from 1920 to 1923 and commander in chief from then until 1927. He was credited with master- minding the final

In that year the incompetent monarchy of King Alfonso XIII fell. He fled the country and a republic was established. The Saragossa academy was dissolved
                                                        on the ground that it was promonarchist and Franco was posted to the Balearic Islands as captain- general. He was brought back in 1933, when the Spanish Republic moved to the right, and he was entrusted,

The Communists held only 17 of 473 seats in the Cortes, or parliament, and the party&apos;s membership throughout the country was estimated at
                                                        less than 10,000. Later, Communist influence in the Government rose, but the party never dominated the regime.</p>

Jose Sanjurjo, in exile in Portugal since the failure of a previous conspiracy in 1932. He visited Germany in February, 1936, and saw
                                                        Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, chief of German military intelligence. According to &quot;the Spanish Civil War&quot; by Hugh Thomas:

                                                        would be contemplated by Canaris at least.&quot;</p>

A private British plane was hired that carried Franco from the Canaries to Teutan in Spanish Morocco, where he was to take command of Moorish and Spanish troops.
                                                        Meantime, according to &quot;The Spanish Republic and the Civil War&quot; by Prof. Gabriel Jackson, &quot;the American colonel who headed the Telephone Company had placed private lines at the disposal

                                                        At the same time Mussolini also began to commit planes and men to the conspirators, and the flow of this support continued throughout the Civil War. Munitions and men were also sent to Franco&apos;s forces in great quantities by Hitler.

The American-owned Vacuum Oil Company in Tangier, for example, refused to sell to Republican ships, according to Professor Jackson. And the Texas Oil Company,
                                                        his book asserts, supplied gasoline on credit to Franco until the war&apos;s end.

Indeed, it seemed for a time that they might fail. They had set themselves up as a Nationalist Government at Burgos in the monarchist heartland of Castile
                                                        in northern Spain, but General Sanjurjo died when his plane, reportedly overloaded with suitcases of his dress uniforms, crashed on take-off in Portugal.

At that time he also received the title of Generalissimo of the Army. His regime was quickly recognized by Germany and Italy.

                                                        The Civil War lasted two years and 254 days before the fall of Madrid to the Franco forces on March 28, 1939. The conflict was waged on both sides with great ferocity, but Franco&apos;s side had the preponderance of foreign aid. The Spanish Government,
                                                        for its part, was able to get some arms from France and the Soviet Union. Despite repeated requests, it received none from the United States. Individual Americans, with men from other nations, fought
                                                        for the Government in the International Brigades, and the Government cause was the emotional rallying point for thousands of anti-Fascists the world over. Some of these, however, became disillusioned
                                                        after witnessing the factionalism and terror among the groups, including the Communists, that supported the Government.

                                                        In the war one of history&apos;s most publicized experiments in calculated terror occurred. That was the bombing of Guernica on market day, April 26, 1937, by the Nazi Condor Legion. It was a Basque town without defenses and without military significance.
                                                        The aviators, in complicity with the Nationalist command, first dropped high-explosive bombs on the townspeople, then machine-gunned them in flight and finally fired the town with incendiary bombs.
                                                        A total of 1,654 persons were killed and 889 wounded in raids lasting 2 hours 45 minutes.

The United States recognized the new Government on April
                                                        1, 1939, and the same month Franco signed the anti-Comintern Pact, formally allying Spain with Germany, Italy and Japan. Pope Pius XII, at about the same time, commended Franco for having brought
                                                        &quot;mercy and justice&quot; to his country. World War II, which began in the fall of 1939, put Franco in a difficult position. His sympathies were with Hitler and Mussolini, but his nation was
                                                        too desolated to join the fighting.</p>

Some of these documents, published by the State Department in 1946 under the title &quot;The Spanish Government and the

                                                    <p>

                                                        Hitler thereupon awarded Franco the cross of the Order of the German Eagle.

                                                        Meeting with Mussolini in Italy in February, 1941, Franco affirmed an &quot;identity of views&quot; between Spain and Italy. Later that month he wrote Hitler:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>

                                                        However, he resisted German demands to use Spain as a stopping point on military flights to Africa. But he did permit German tankers to use Spanish coastal waters in the refueling of submarines, and he relayed to the Axis information of Allied convoys
                                                        passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. He also helped recruit the Spanish Blue Division, which joined German troops in the Soviet Union.

                                                        In the meantime, Franco was hedging his bets. A British-Spanish trade accord was signed in March, 1940, which was extended to other Allied powers. The dictator made it plain that he was a nonbelligerent.

                                                        Shortly after the American troop landings in North Africa in November, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told Franco that the Allies harbored no aggressive intentions toward Spain. In reply, Franco cited the &quot;relations of friendship which unite
                                                        our people and which should be preserved.&quot; He also removed his brother-in-law, Ramon Serrano Suner, an avowed Axis man, as Foreign Minister.

                                                        When the fortunes of the Axis declined, Franco&apos;s vigilant neutrality increased, although he made at least one effort to promote peace between Germany and Britain so that the two countries could undertake &quot;common action&quot; against &quot;the

                                                        After the war, nonetheless, the Allies put Franco temporarily beyond the pale, and the United States and many other nations withdrew their ambassadors or ministers from Madrid, but kept a charge d&apos;affaires there. The diplomatic boycott of Franco
                                                        Spain ended in fact if not in name in November, 1950--a consequence of the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, in which Spain occupied a geographically important place.

And in February, 1951, Stanton Griffis became the United States Ambassador to Madrid. That July the late Adm. Forrest P. Sherman opened talks with Franco about

This entrance into the community of nations was further signalized in December, 1959, when President Eisenhower went to Madrid

After seeming to favor Don Juan, son of Alfonso XIII, who fled the throne in 1931, he finally settled on Juan Carlos, Don Juan&apos;s son. In presenting him to the Cortes in 1969, Franco said:

Riding in his black Rolls-Royce, which carried the national coat of arms in place of license plates, he was preceded by an open car filled with burly red-bereted bodyguards and his route was flanked by
                                                        policemen stationed 10 yards apart. He demanded the homage reserved for royalty, walking under a canopy, for example, at religious rites.

Wednesday Audiences

                                                    <p>
                                                        His round, mustached face was immobile and his brown eyes were appraising and chill. This hauteur was evident at his Wednesday audiences for Spanish and foreign civilians and Spanish military men. Strictly according to protocol, they approached Franco,
                                                        singly or in groups. There was a brief formal greeting and that was all.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Remote in his personality, the dictator nonetheless appeared often in public. He attended openings of everything from theaters to industrial exhibits. On these occasions, he waved in his stiff, almost timid manner and forced a smile here and there; but
                                                        there seemed to be almost no rapport between him and the population. Crowds regarded him as more of an institution than as a person.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Franco lived and worked at El Pardo, a former royal hunting lodge on the outskirts of Madrid. His spacious office was furnished with Aubusson carpets, velvet draperies and gilt- inlaid furniture. The photographs on the walls changed over the years. Once
                                                        there were inscribed portraits of Hitler and Mussolini; later there was one of President Eisenhower, and that was replaced by one of Pope Paul VI.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Franco&apos;s ormolu-mounted desk and a nearby table were piled with reports and memorandums, virtually all of them unread. &quot;When the piles become too high,&quot; he once told Prince Juan Carlos, &quot;I have everything taken out from the bottom
                                                        and burned.&quot; Franco was reported to have chuckled at his own remark. He was, however, enormously well-informed, for he listened to his ministers and subordinates and visitors, and he read newspapers
                                                        with care.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Some of this listening was done at semimonthly Cabinet meetings, over which he presided with great imperturbability. These sessions began at 9 A.M. and often continued all day and through the night, for they dealt not only with major matters but also
                                                        with such trivia as a medal for a minor civil servant. Ministers might argue or step outside for a smoke (Franco forbade smoking in his presence), but the dictator was never known to get up from
                                                        his chair or to relax the stiffness of his posture. Nor did he often interrupt his ministers or decide questions precipitously.

                                                        Franco was celebrated for his secretiveness. &quot;Not even his collar knows what he is thinking,&quot; an associate once remarked. Thus, it was difficult to read his mind, and it was not uncommon for a subordinate, even a minister, to leave an audience
                                                        convinced that he had made a splendid impression and the next morning to receive a letter from Franco thanking him for his services and informing him that he had been replaced.

Flattered in News Media

                                                    <p>
                                                        Franco was much flattered by the controlled press, radio and television. It was not unusual for him to be ranked above Augustus, Charles V and Napoleon. About 50 towns caught the spirit of this sycophancy and added his name.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He also had constructed a Pharaonic tomb, in which he wanted to be buried. Called the Valley of the Fallen and dedicated to the Civil War dead, it is situated close to the Escorial, near Madrid. Carved out of living rock, the interior is a basilica, one
                                                        of the world&apos;s largest, and is surmounted by a cross 500 feet tall. Franco took a detailed interest in its construction, which covered 15 years and cost millions. Irreverent Spaniards called
                                                        it &quot;Franco&apos;s folly,&quot; but it became a major tourist attraction.

                                                        An avid sportsman, the dictator liked to shoot mountain goats, deer, rabbits and partridges. His bag of these birds sometimes reached 300 a day.

                                                        Franco&apos;s cruelty was that of the centurion, impersonal and efficient. Once, inspecting troops as a colonel of the Spanish Foreign Legion, he had food thrown in his face by a legionnaire protesting its quality. It spattered his uniform, but his facial
                                                        expression did not change, nor did he say a word. He merely took out his handkerchief, wiped off the food and continued the inspection. Returning to his office, he calmly called an officer, pointed
                                                        out the offender and said:</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Take that soldier out and execute him.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He exhibited the same methodical cruelty in 1934 when he imported legionnaires and Moors to crush an Asturian miners&apos; uprising. At least 2,000 miners were rounded up and executed, many of them in the Oviedo bullring. Some officers reportedly sought
                                                        to halt the slaughter, but Franco sent word that the officers must continue or face execution themselves.

Virtually a Teetotaler
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Franco&apos;s home life was simple. He dined with his family as often as possible, and lightly to keep his girth down. He was virtually a teetotaler, limiting himself to a glass of wine or beer at a meal. There was no hint of personal scandal in his private
                                                        life. He had married Carmen Polo y Martinez Valdes, a young woman of good Asturian family, in 1923.

                                                        If Franco felt any reaction to criticism or had any self-doubt, it was not observable. Indeed, he had a Moslem-like fatalism, the &quot;maktoob&quot; (&quot;It is written&quot;) of the Moroccan rifleman. Horses were shot beneath him. Once a bullet struck
                                                        a flask from which he was drinking. Leading an assault in 1916, he was shot through the abdomen, but recovered uneventfully. In 1961, the barrel of his gun exploded in his left hand as he was shooting
                                                        pigeons, but his hand was saved.

                                                        A similar fatalism, or impassivity, seemed to attend Franco in moments of domestic tension as, for example, when five convicted Basque terrorists were executed in September, 1975. Although the Vatican and most Western European countries protested or asked
                                                        for clemency, he had the sentences carried out.

                                                        The executions also led to speeches at the United Nations and to threatened economic sanctions by the Common Market. The regime, however, did not appear to be swayed.
