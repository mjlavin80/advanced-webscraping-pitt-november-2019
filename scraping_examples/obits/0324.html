                                                        DETROIT, Oct. 31.--Harry Houdini, world famous as a magician, a defier of locks and sealed chests and an exposer of spiritualist frauds, died here this afternoon after a week&apos;s struggle for life, in which he underwent two operations.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Death was due to peritonitis, which followed the first operation, that for appendicitis. The second operation was performed last Friday. Like a newly discovered serum, used for the first time in Houdini&apos;s case, it was of no avail.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The chapter of accidents which ended fatally for the man who so often had seemed to thousands to be cheating the very jaws of death began early in October at Albany, N. Y. On the opening night of his engagement at a theatre there a piece of apparatus
                                                        used in his &quot;water torture cell&quot; trick was overturned and struck him on the foot. Houdini called a physician from the audience, had his foot examined and then completed his performance.
                                                        Afterward he went to a hospital and had the injured foot X-rayed.

                                                        A bone was found to be partly fractured and Houdini was advised to discontinue his tour a few days and give prompt attention and plenty of rest to the injured foot. He declined to cancel his engagements, however, and did not miss a show.

                                                        On Tuesday, Oct. 19, while in Montreal he addressed a class of students on spiritualistic tricks. During a reception following the address he commented on the strength of his stomach muscles and their ability to withstand hard blows without injury.

He suffered no distress at the time but after he had boarded a train for Detroit he complained of pain. At first he attributed it
                                                        to something he had eaten but as it increased he called in the company&apos;s nurse, who in turn arranged by wire to have a physician meet the magician in Detroit.

He left it to Houdini to decide whether it would be advisable for him to appear that evening at the Garrick Theatre for the opening
                                                        night of the show. Houdini would not disappoint his admirers.

He felt the grip of bonds he had never tested, the snap of a lock not forged by human hands. He was worried for one of
                                                        the few times in his career and was plainly not up to his best form in some of his tricks.

Houdini was taken to Gray Hospital and the following afternoon underwent an operation for appendicitis. His removal from the hotel
                                                        to the hospital was made at the suggestion of his family physician, William Stone of New York City, who had been notified by telephone of his friend&apos;s condition.

The physicians who attended him say he was the best patient they ever had, and he helped them wonderfully. His mental attitude, combined with his unusual stamina, did much to prolong
                                                        his life.

                                                        Whatever the methods by which Harry Houdini deceived a large part of the world for nearly four decades, his career stamped him as one of the greatest showmen of modern times. In his special field of entertainment he stood alone. With a few minor exceptions,
                                                        he invented all his tricks and illusions, and in certain instances only his four intimate helpers knew the solution. In one or two very important cases Houdini, himself, alone knew the whole secret.

                                                        Houdini was born on March 24, 1874. His name originally was Eric Weiss and he was the son of a rabbi. He did not take the name Harry Houdini until he had been a performer for many years. Legend has it that he opened his first lock when he wanted a piece
                                                        of pie in the kitchen closet. It is certain that when scarcely more than a baby he showed skill as an acrobat and contortionist, and both these talents helped his start in the show business and his
                                                        later development as an &quot;escape king.&quot;

                                                        At the age of 9 Houdini joined a traveling circus, touring Wisconsin as a contortionist and trapeze performer. The Davenport brothers were then famous, doing the first spiritualist work ever seen in this country. They would ring bells while bound inside
                                                        a cabinet and would agree to free themselves from any bonds. This inspired Houdini to a somewhat similar performance. Standing in the middle of the ring, he would invite any one to tie him with ropes
                                                        and would then free himself inside the cabinet.

                                                    </p>

                                                        Houdini, still only a boy, told him to go ahead. After a much longer stay in the cabinet than usual, the performer emerged, carrying the handcuffs in his free hands. That was the beginning of his long series of escapes from every known sort of manacle.
                                                        For years he called himself the Handcuff King, a title discarded as he extended and elevated the range of his performances.

In 1900 he made his first visit abroad, and
                                                        in London his sensational escapes from handcuffs at Scotland Yard won him a six months engagement at the Alhambra. This was the first instance of his cleverly obtaining notoriety by a public or semi-public
                                                        exhibition outside the theatre. No other showman, unless it was Barnum, knew better how to arouse the curiosity and amazement of the public in this manner.

Escaped From Dozens of Prisons</b></p>

In the Krupp plant at Essen he met the challenge of the workmen and freed himself from expertly constructed shackles before 70,000 persons. He returned to America to find

                                                        prison at Washington, the cell in which Guiteau, President Garfield&apos;s assassin, had been confined.

And he would free himself from the so-called torture cell, his own
                                                        invention. In this he was suspended, head down, in a tank of water. To thrill the general public he would hang from the roof of a skyscraper, bound in a strait-jacket, from which he would wriggle
                                                        free to the applause of the crowd in the street below. Thrown from a boat or bridge into a river, bound hand and foot and locked and nailed in a box, doomed to certain death by drowning or suffocation,
                                                        he would emerge in a minute or so, a free man, swimming vigorously to safety.

Occasionally others would attempt to imitate him, but his supremacy never was remotely threatened. An evidence of the

A number of other well-known men were present, all of them having intelligence of a high order. Certainly it was not a credulous audience.
                                                        I offered to summon the spirits and have them answer any questions that might be asked.

                                                        &quot;Roosevelt wanted to know if they could tell him where he had spent Christmas Day. I had a slate with the usual covering and in a few moments brought forth a map, done in a dozen different colors of chalk, which indicated the spot where he had been
                                                        on the famous River of Doubt. That map was an exact duplicate of one that was to appear in his book which had not been published. I had never seen the map and, to make my case stronger, the name
                                                        of W. T. Stead, the English spiritualist and writer who lost his life on the Titanic, was signed below the map in a handwriting which one man present instantly recognized as that of Stead. And I
                                                        might add that I was unfamiliar with Stead&apos;s signature.

                                                        The magician tried his hand at the medium business in his early days in Kansas and used to tell in this wise how he prepared for one of his first seances:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I had gone around to the cemeteries and read all of the inscriptions on tombstones, looked over a few birth and death records and acquired a lot of information from the gossips. When the time arrived for my act I puzzled the crowd by giving particulars
                                                        of births and deaths in half of the families of the town. Gradually I worked up to a climax, exclaiming:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;&apos;Now what do I see? What is this coming before me? Why, it is a man--a black man. He&apos;s lame--and his throat is cut from ear to ear. Who is this man?--why, I know him; he is Efram--Efram Alexander.&apos; The negroes at the meeting deserted
                                                        in a body with shrieks because they recognized a negro who had been killed recently.&quot;

                                                        For thirty-three years Houdini tried to solve the mysteries of spiritism. He told friends he was ready to believe, was anxious to believe, because he would find joy in proof that he could communicate with his father, mother and friends who had passed
                                                        on. He had agreed with friends and acquaintances, numbering hundreds, that the first to die was to try to communicate from the spirit world to the world of reality. Fourteen of those friends had
                                                        died, but none had ever given a sign, he said.

Sargent, one of those who exposed Palladino in this city. Our relations were most intimate. He died and I have not heard from him. Such an agreement I made with
                                                        both my parents. They died and I have not heard from them. I thought once I saw my mother in a vision, but I now believe it was imagination.

                                                        &quot;Another thing that seemed almost supernatural to me occurred at the death of William Berol, a mystifier and close friend of mine. We had worked together on the stage and had a private telegraphic code for signaling messages. We made a compact that
                                                        the first who died should use that code to communicate with the other. At his deathbed I held Berol&apos;s hand. He had been unconscious for some time. He showed no outward signs of a return to consciousness.
                                                        His eyes remained closed. But just as he passed away I could feel his hand making a faint pressure upon mine. That was repeated at intervals and I could recognize that the man who seemed unconscious
                                                        and at death&apos;s door was talking to me in code. I received and understood his message. But I hold it sacred and have never repeated it.&quot;

                                                        Houdini counted that he had had &quot;four close-ups with death&quot; in his career of more than thirty years as a mystifier. The closest was in California, where he risked his life on a bet and not as a public performance. Seven years ago in Los Angeles
                                                        he made a wager that he could free himself from a six-foot grave into which he was to be buried after being manacled. He had first accustomed himself to the sensation of burial by more shallow interments.

                                                        nearly cost me my life, for it caused me to waste a fraction of breath when every fraction was needed to pull through. I had kept the sand loose about my body so that I could work dexterously. I
                                                        did. But as I clawed and kneed the earth my strength began to fail. Then I made another mistake. I yelled. Or, at least, I attempted to, and the last remnants of my self-possession left me. Then
                                                        instinct stepped in to the rescue. With my last reserve strength I fought through, more sand than air entering my nostrils. The sunlight came like a blinding blessing, and my friends about the grave
                                                        said that, chalky pale and wild-eyed as I was, I presented a perfect imitation of a dead man rising.

He remained there for more than an hour and a half, bettering the record of the Egyptian fakir,
                                                        Rahmin Bey.

He began to cancel engagements
                                                        that conflicted with a period of training he mapped out for himself.

                                                        DETROIT, Oct. 31.--Harry Houdini, world famous as a magician, a defier of locks and sealed chests and an exposer of spiritualist frauds, died here this afternoon after a week&apos;s struggle for life, in which he underwent two operations.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Death was due to peritonitis, which followed the first operation, that for appendicitis. The second operation was performed last Friday. Like a newly discovered serum, used for the first time in Houdini&apos;s case, it was of no avail.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The chapter of accidents which ended fatally for the man who so often had seemed to thousands to be cheating the very jaws of death began early in October at Albany, N. Y. On the opening night of his engagement at a theatre there a piece of apparatus
                                                        used in his &quot;water torture cell&quot; trick was overturned and struck him on the foot. Houdini called a physician from the audience, had his foot examined and then completed his performance.
                                                        Afterward he went to a hospital and had the injured foot X-rayed.

                                                        A bone was found to be partly fractured and Houdini was advised to discontinue his tour a few days and give prompt attention and plenty of rest to the injured foot. He declined to cancel his engagements, however, and did not miss a show.

                                                        On Tuesday, Oct. 19, while in Montreal he addressed a class of students on spiritualistic tricks. During a reception following the address he commented on the strength of his stomach muscles and their ability to withstand hard blows without injury.

He suffered no distress at the time but after he had boarded a train for Detroit he complained of pain. At first he attributed it
                                                        to something he had eaten but as it increased he called in the company&apos;s nurse, who in turn arranged by wire to have a physician meet the magician in Detroit.

He left it to Houdini to decide whether it would be advisable for him to appear that evening at the Garrick Theatre for the opening
                                                        night of the show. Houdini would not disappoint his admirers.

He felt the grip of bonds he had never tested, the snap of a lock not forged by human hands. He was worried for one of
                                                        the few times in his career and was plainly not up to his best form in some of his tricks.

Houdini was taken to Gray Hospital and the following afternoon underwent an operation for appendicitis. His removal from the hotel
                                                        to the hospital was made at the suggestion of his family physician, William Stone of New York City, who had been notified by telephone of his friend&apos;s condition.

The physicians who attended him say he was the best patient they ever had, and he helped them wonderfully. His mental attitude, combined with his unusual stamina, did much to prolong
                                                        his life.

                                                        Whatever the methods by which Harry Houdini deceived a large part of the world for nearly four decades, his career stamped him as one of the greatest showmen of modern times. In his special field of entertainment he stood alone. With a few minor exceptions,
                                                        he invented all his tricks and illusions, and in certain instances only his four intimate helpers knew the solution. In one or two very important cases Houdini, himself, alone knew the whole secret.

                                                        Houdini was born on March 24, 1874. His name originally was Eric Weiss and he was the son of a rabbi. He did not take the name Harry Houdini until he had been a performer for many years. Legend has it that he opened his first lock when he wanted a piece
                                                        of pie in the kitchen closet. It is certain that when scarcely more than a baby he showed skill as an acrobat and contortionist, and both these talents helped his start in the show business and his
                                                        later development as an &quot;escape king.&quot;

                                                        At the age of 9 Houdini joined a traveling circus, touring Wisconsin as a contortionist and trapeze performer. The Davenport brothers were then famous, doing the first spiritualist work ever seen in this country. They would ring bells while bound inside
                                                        a cabinet and would agree to free themselves from any bonds. This inspired Houdini to a somewhat similar performance. Standing in the middle of the ring, he would invite any one to tie him with ropes
                                                        and would then free himself inside the cabinet.

                                                    </p>

                                                        Houdini, still only a boy, told him to go ahead. After a much longer stay in the cabinet than usual, the performer emerged, carrying the handcuffs in his free hands. That was the beginning of his long series of escapes from every known sort of manacle.
                                                        For years he called himself the Handcuff King, a title discarded as he extended and elevated the range of his performances.

In 1900 he made his first visit abroad, and
                                                        in London his sensational escapes from handcuffs at Scotland Yard won him a six months engagement at the Alhambra. This was the first instance of his cleverly obtaining notoriety by a public or semi-public
                                                        exhibition outside the theatre. No other showman, unless it was Barnum, knew better how to arouse the curiosity and amazement of the public in this manner.

Escaped From Dozens of Prisons</b></p>

In the Krupp plant at Essen he met the challenge of the workmen and freed himself from expertly constructed shackles before 70,000 persons. He returned to America to find

                                                        prison at Washington, the cell in which Guiteau, President Garfield&apos;s assassin, had been confined.

And he would free himself from the so-called torture cell, his own
                                                        invention. In this he was suspended, head down, in a tank of water. To thrill the general public he would hang from the roof of a skyscraper, bound in a strait-jacket, from which he would wriggle
                                                        free to the applause of the crowd in the street below. Thrown from a boat or bridge into a river, bound hand and foot and locked and nailed in a box, doomed to certain death by drowning or suffocation,
                                                        he would emerge in a minute or so, a free man, swimming vigorously to safety.

Occasionally others would attempt to imitate him, but his supremacy never was remotely threatened. An evidence of the

A number of other well-known men were present, all of them having intelligence of a high order. Certainly it was not a credulous audience.
                                                        I offered to summon the spirits and have them answer any questions that might be asked.

                                                        &quot;Roosevelt wanted to know if they could tell him where he had spent Christmas Day. I had a slate with the usual covering and in a few moments brought forth a map, done in a dozen different colors of chalk, which indicated the spot where he had been
                                                        on the famous River of Doubt. That map was an exact duplicate of one that was to appear in his book which had not been published. I had never seen the map and, to make my case stronger, the name
                                                        of W. T. Stead, the English spiritualist and writer who lost his life on the Titanic, was signed below the map in a handwriting which one man present instantly recognized as that of Stead. And I
                                                        might add that I was unfamiliar with Stead&apos;s signature.

                                                        The magician tried his hand at the medium business in his early days in Kansas and used to tell in this wise how he prepared for one of his first seances:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I had gone around to the cemeteries and read all of the inscriptions on tombstones, looked over a few birth and death records and acquired a lot of information from the gossips. When the time arrived for my act I puzzled the crowd by giving particulars
                                                        of births and deaths in half of the families of the town. Gradually I worked up to a climax, exclaiming:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;&apos;Now what do I see? What is this coming before me? Why, it is a man--a black man. He&apos;s lame--and his throat is cut from ear to ear. Who is this man?--why, I know him; he is Efram--Efram Alexander.&apos; The negroes at the meeting deserted
                                                        in a body with shrieks because they recognized a negro who had been killed recently.&quot;

                                                        For thirty-three years Houdini tried to solve the mysteries of spiritism. He told friends he was ready to believe, was anxious to believe, because he would find joy in proof that he could communicate with his father, mother and friends who had passed
                                                        on. He had agreed with friends and acquaintances, numbering hundreds, that the first to die was to try to communicate from the spirit world to the world of reality. Fourteen of those friends had
                                                        died, but none had ever given a sign, he said.

Sargent, one of those who exposed Palladino in this city. Our relations were most intimate. He died and I have not heard from him. Such an agreement I made with
                                                        both my parents. They died and I have not heard from them. I thought once I saw my mother in a vision, but I now believe it was imagination.

                                                        &quot;Another thing that seemed almost supernatural to me occurred at the death of William Berol, a mystifier and close friend of mine. We had worked together on the stage and had a private telegraphic code for signaling messages. We made a compact that
                                                        the first who died should use that code to communicate with the other. At his deathbed I held Berol&apos;s hand. He had been unconscious for some time. He showed no outward signs of a return to consciousness.
                                                        His eyes remained closed. But just as he passed away I could feel his hand making a faint pressure upon mine. That was repeated at intervals and I could recognize that the man who seemed unconscious
                                                        and at death&apos;s door was talking to me in code. I received and understood his message. But I hold it sacred and have never repeated it.&quot;

                                                        Houdini counted that he had had &quot;four close-ups with death&quot; in his career of more than thirty years as a mystifier. The closest was in California, where he risked his life on a bet and not as a public performance. Seven years ago in Los Angeles
                                                        he made a wager that he could free himself from a six-foot grave into which he was to be buried after being manacled. He had first accustomed himself to the sensation of burial by more shallow interments.

                                                        nearly cost me my life, for it caused me to waste a fraction of breath when every fraction was needed to pull through. I had kept the sand loose about my body so that I could work dexterously. I
                                                        did. But as I clawed and kneed the earth my strength began to fail. Then I made another mistake. I yelled. Or, at least, I attempted to, and the last remnants of my self-possession left me. Then
                                                        instinct stepped in to the rescue. With my last reserve strength I fought through, more sand than air entering my nostrils. The sunlight came like a blinding blessing, and my friends about the grave
                                                        said that, chalky pale and wild-eyed as I was, I presented a perfect imitation of a dead man rising.

He remained there for more than an hour and a half, bettering the record of the Egyptian fakir,
                                                        Rahmin Bey.

He began to cancel engagements
                                                        that conflicted with a period of training he mapped out for himself.
