                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Walter White, executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, died last night of a heart attack at his home at his home, 242 East Sixty-eighth Street. He was 61
                                                        years old.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Last October he twice entered the New York Hospital for treatment for a heart ailment that had caused him to take a leave of absence from his duties.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Recently he had returned from a month&apos;s leisurely visit in Haiti and Puerto Rico. Yesterday he spent two hours at his office.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. White, the nearest approach to a national leader of American Negroes since Booker T. Washington, was a Negro by choice.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Only five-thirty-seconds of his ancestry was Negro. His skin was fair, his hair blond, his eyes blue and his features Caucasian. He could easily have joined the 12,000 Negroes who pass the color-line and disappear into the white majority every year in
                                                        this country.
                                                    </p>
