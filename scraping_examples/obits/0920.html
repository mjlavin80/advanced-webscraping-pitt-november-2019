He was &quot;mired in melodrama and sentiment,&quot; they said, a man who belabored the obvious with &quot;increasingly irrelevant prejudices.&quot; But in Europe he was more generously
                                                        acclaimed, usually as an &quot;American Ibsen of fiction,&quot; a reference to the Norwegian realist of the theater.

Indeed, he was among the most widely read of American writers abroad. Paradoxically, his books were well regarded in the Soviet Union, toward whose

In fact, he was a member of that party from 1902 to 1934, with an interruption for World War I, which he supported and later condemned. He left the party in 1934 to become a Democrat, but continued
                                                        to regard himself as a Socialist in spirit.

He envisioned a cooperative commonwealth for the United States, to be achieved gradually and through the electoral process. He was primarily a moralist; his concern was social injustice, not social analysis.
                                                        There was no evidence that he was a Marxist, much less an advocate of Communism.

Yet in speech and thought he was a temperate man, who regretted, as he said, that &quot;I&apos;ve

He was an agile 5-foot-7-inches, who played a fair game of tennis into his 70&apos;s and who subsisted largely on a diet of brown

One of the others was H. L. Mencken,
                                                        the earthy editor of The American Mercury, with whose political conservatism and defense of drinking Mr. Sinclair often argued.

When he was attending lectures at Columbia after his City College days, he wrote 8,000 words a day, Sundays included. &quot;I kept two secretaries working all the time,

In addition, at Columbia, he taught himself to read French in six weeks, and galloped through Musset, Daudet,
                                                        Hugo, Flaubert, Balzac and Zola. He also taught himself Italian and, later, Esperanto and German.

                                                        ways of life,&quot; he thought. &quot;Long ago my friend Mike Gold wrote me a letter, scolding me severely for what he called my &apos;Jesus complex&apos;; I answered that the world needs a Jesus

It was privately published in 1901 and then reissued as &quot;King Midas&quot; by Funk &amp; Wagnalls. On the strength of its middling

Mrs. Sinclair fell in love with Harry Kemp, the poet, and Mr. Sinclair, then in the Netherlands, obtained a divorce. In referring to this marriage in later writings, the author

At the same time he wrote &quot;The Wet Parade,&quot; an impassioned
                                                        plea for Prohibition. And from materials furnished by William Fox, the motion picture tycoon, he wrote &quot;Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox,&quot; a partisan exposition of Mr. Fox&apos;s many
                                                        business troubles in Hollywood. As a spin-off of his interest in the movies, Mr. Sinclair, in 1933, was a sponsor of Sergei Eisenstein&apos;s classic documentary, &quot;Thunder Over Mexico.&quot;

                                                        Although Mr. Sinclair had often sought office as a Socialist--the House in 1906 and 1920, the Senate in 1922 and Governor of California in 1926, 1930 and 1934--his race in 1934 was his most dazzling. Of a population of seven million in that year, California
                                                        had a million out of work, its public relief funds were exhausted and its industries were all but stilled.

Let them be put to work on the state&apos;s credit and produce goods for their own use, and set up a system of exchange by which the
                                                        goods could be distributed.

Politicians Astonished

                                                    <p>
                                                        This was the essence of EPIC--End Poverty in California--the platform on which Mr. Sinclair ran in the Democratic primary. To the astonishment and shock of professional politicians, he won by 436,000 votes.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When Mr. Sinclair faced Frank E. Merriam, the incumbent Republican, in the general election, it seemed obvious to many observers that &quot;Uppie,&quot; as the Democrat was affectionately called, was going to win. The conservative Los Angeles Times, however,
                                                        was instrumental in bringing about his defeat by conducting an inflammatory campaign that pictured him as a man who would not only &quot;sovietize&quot; the state but also introduce free love and
                                                        the nationalization of children.

                                                        That newspaper and others succeeded in frightening substantial numbers of conventional voters. The movie industry, moreover, threatened its employes with dismissal if they voted for Mr. Sinclair. In addition, the national Democratic party quietly worked
                                                        to scuttle the EPIC movement. In the face of these factors, Mr. Sinclair&apos;s zealous campaigning with an amateur organization rolled up a remarkable total of 879,000 votes, about 200,000 short
                                                        of victory.

Writing Pace Slackened

                                                        Retiring from electoral politics for good, he devoted his time to further writing--a one-act play about his cousin, Wallis Warfield, now the Dutchess of Windsor; a novel about Henry Ford; and the Lanny Budd series. His pace slackened in the nineteen-fifties
                                                        to only eight books--one a temperance plea--in 10 years. In 1960 he published some of his letters, and his autobiography appeared in 1962.

Indeed, he specified 10 achievements: clean meat; better newspapers; the ending of &quot;wage slavery&quot; in the Rocky Mountain mining camps; spurring
                                                        an interest in psychic phenomena; helping to organize the American Civil Liberties Union; his EPIC campaign; his democratic influence in Japan, where his books were widely circulated; his campaign
                                                        against drinking; his founding of the college Socialist society, and the Lanny Budd books.

I have incorporated those beliefs in a hundred books and pamphlets and numberless
                                                        articles. My books have been translated into 40 languages, and millions of people have read them.
