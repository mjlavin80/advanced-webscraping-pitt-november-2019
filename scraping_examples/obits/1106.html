                                                    </p>

                                                        He came to Reading to lead the local Ringgold Band today in its 80th Anniversary concert as its guest conductor. He rehearsed the band yesterday afternoon and at that time showed no signs of illness. Last night he attended a civic dinner at the hotel
                                                        in his honor at which 100 leading citizens and all the members of the Lincoln Band were present. In response to laudatory addresses he made a brief speech, asking to be excused from saying more in
                                                        order that he might save his strength for the concert ahead of him. He told two or three funny stories, reminiscences of his long career, and sat down amid great applause.

                                                        he wanted to live to be 100 so that he could write many more marches.

Conductor Since 1878

                                                    <p>
                                                        John Philip Sousa had been a conductor since 1878 and had been a musician since about 1861. The Famous Sousa Band, his own organization, has been in existence for nearly forty years and for the twenty years immediately preceding he was the conductor of
                                                        the Marine Band attached to the President&apos;s household.

                                                        Throughout his career as a conductor he had also been a composer, and it is an open question which of his two activities brought him the greater renown. It would be difficult to segregate the two, however, for his marches, his band and his personality
                                                        served as a single unit in creating his unique reputation.

                                                        Mr. Sousa was born in Washington in 1854. The fact that his father was a musician and a member of the Marine Band which his son was later to lead, combined with the marital spirit of Civil War days of his youth in Washington, served to give his talent
                                                        the bent which made him the &quot;march king&quot; to all the world for a quarter of a century.

                                                        His musical education began at 7. He had already made up his mind that he wanted to be a musician, and four years later he won all the medals at the conservatory, the beginning of his collection of decorations, which is said to be the largest in his field
                                                        in the world. That same year he became a violin soloist, and two years later his father enrolled him as an apprentice with the Marine Band.

                                                        After several years with that organization he left it to join a theatrical orchestra, and early in this period of his career he had an opportunity to substitute for the conductor. He was a conductor from that day on, and in 1880 he was appointed to head
                                                        the Marine Band at the White House. Three years earlier, at 23, he had been first violinist in the orchestra conducted by Jacques Offenbach during the latter&apos;s tour of this country.

                                                        His service at the White House covered the terms of Presidents Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland and Harrison. Many of his most famous musical works were composed during this period. One of these, &quot;The Washington Post March,&quot; was adopted by
                                                        many dancing masters for use in teaching the two-step, which was just being introduced at the time. He sold that composition, which is still widely played, for $35.

Organized Band in 1892

                                                        Mr. Sousa organized his own band in 1892. It was not long before he attained world fame. It has been estimated that the band covered an aggregate itinerary of a million and a quarter miles, visiting nearly every city in this country, a great many in Europe
                                                        and others in all parts of the world. The wide travels of the band throughout the United States on the semi-annual tours which were its customary program are considered to have contributed toward
                                                        the furtherance of musical education in the nation.

After the exposition the band toured Europe, being the first musical organization from this country in a quarter
                                                        of a century to undertake a tour of the Continent. Enthusiastic appearances were made in France, Germany, Belgium and Holland.

The leader and his 100 musicians covered 60,000 miles, visiting Europe, Africa, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Honolulu
                                                        and the Fiji Islands. Four years later they remained the entire season at the Hippodrome here, playing to 60,000 persons each week.

At the time it

                                                        messages, including one from Commander Richard E. Byrd at Little America, in the Antarctic Region.

The march was composed in honor
                                                        of the cooperation of the famous Welsh regiment with the American marines in the relief of Tientsin in the Boxer uprising. He later conducted the Fusiliers&apos; own band in the march and was entertained
