The West was raw, great parts of it wilderness as yet only sketchily explored. A majority of the nation&apos;s citizens still considered the enslavement
                                                        of Negroes as the operation of a law of God, and Darwin had not yet published his &quot;Origin of Species.&quot;

                                                        The circumstances of his birth were fortunate. His father, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, was of New England&apos;s ruling caste and the atmosphere of his home was at once brahminical, scientific and literary. They boy was to start each day at that &quot;autocratic&quot;

                                                        The boy was prepared for Harvard by E. S. Dixwell of Cambridge. He was fortunate again in this. Well-tutored, he made an excellent record in college. His intimacy with Mr. Dixwell&apos;s household was very close. His tutor&apos;s daughter, Fanny Dixwell,
                                                        and he fell in love with each other and later they were married.

                                                        Fort Sumter was fired on and President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. Young Holmes, 20 years old and shortly to be graduated from Harvard with the class of &apos;61, walked down Beacon Hill with an open Hobbe&apos;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; in his
                                                        hand and learned that he was commissioned in the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers.

There were grave tactical errors and the Union troops were driven down the cliff on
                                                        the Virginia shore and into the Potomac. Men trying to swim to safety were killed and wounded men were drowned.

The search lasted many worried days and brought the father close to the lines at several points. He found his
                                                        son already convalescent and brought him back to Boston, where he wrote his experiences under the title, &quot;My Hunt for the Captain,&quot; an article that was enthusiastically received as bringing
                                                        home to Boston a first-hand picture of the trials of war directly behind the lines.

He had been class poet and prize essayist in college. But he finally turned to law, although it was long before he was
                                                        sure that he had taken the best course.

Through long nights they discussed their &quot;dilapidated old friend the Kosmos.&quot; James later was
                                                        to write in affectionate reminiscence of &quot;your whitely lit-up room, drinking in your profound wisdom, your golden jibes, your costly imagery, listening to your shuddering laughter.&quot;

                                                        he drove deep into the study of the law.

Early in 1867 he was admitted to the bar and James noted that &quot;Wendell is working too hard.&quot; The hard work brought results. In 1870 he was made editor of the American Law

It was into these early papers that he put the fundamentals of an exposition
                                                        of the law that he was later to deliver in Lowell Lectures at Harvard and to publish under the title, &quot;The Common Law.&quot; In this book, to quote Benjamin N. Cardozo, he &quot;packed a whole

                                                        and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&quot;

                                                        In April, 1903, the lower court decided for the government and 8,000 pages of records and briefs went to the United States Supreme Court for final review. On March 14, 1904, the high court found for the government, with Justice Holmes writing in dissent.
                                                    </p>

                                                        He held that the Sherman act did not prescribe the rule of &quot;free competition among those engaged in interstate commerce,&quot; as the majority held. It merely forbade &quot;restraint of trade or commerce.&quot; He asserted that the phrases &quot;restraint
                                                        of competition&quot; and &quot;restraint of trade&quot; did not have the same meaning; that &quot;restraint of trade,&quot; which had &quot;a definite and well-established significance in the common
                                                        law, means and had always been understand to mean, a combination made by men engaged in a certain business for the purpose of keeping other men out of that business * * *.&quot;

                                                        The objection to trusts was not the union of former competitors, but the sinister power exercised, or supposed to be exercised, by the combination in keeping rivals out of the business, he said. It was the ferocious extreme of competition with others,
                                                        not the cessation of competition among the partners, which was the evil feared.

                                                        &quot;Much trouble,&quot; he continued, &quot;is made by substituting other phrases, assumed to be equivalent, which are then argued from as if they were in the act. The court below argued as if maintaining competition were the express purpose of the
                                                        act. The act says nothing about competition.&quot;

                                                        It was at this time that John Morley visited America and returned to England with the affirmation that in Justice Homes America possessed the greatest judge of the English- speaking world. Time has reinforced the emphasis. In his years on the Supreme
                                                        Court bench he had done more to mold the texture of the Constitution than any man since John Marshall revealed to the American people what their new Constitution might imply.

Excerpts From Holmes&apos;s Writings</b></p>

                                                        From the opinions and other writings of Justice Holmes the following lines are some that might be used for this test:
                                                    </p>

                                                        test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried out. That, at any rate,
                                                        is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.&quot;

But to gather the streams from waste and to draw
                                                        from them energy, labor without brains, and so to save mankind from toil that it can be spared, is to supply what, next to intellect, is the very foundation of all our achievements and all our welfare.
                                                        If that purpose is not public, we should be at a loss to say what is.&quot;

                                                        disagree. Considerable latitude must be allowed for difference of view as well as for possible peculiar conditions which this court can know but imperfectly, if at all. Otherwise a Constitution,

He lived as he advised others to live, in the &quot;grand manner.&quot; He sought quality rather than quantity of experience and knowledge of his success in living helped others to find it,

Left Bench Jan. 12, 1932</b></p>

                                                        Justice Holmes resigned on Jan. 12, 1932. &quot;The time has now come and I bow to the inevitable,&quot; he wrote to the President. He left, amid national regret, almost thirty years after he had been appointed to the Supreme Court bench.

                                                        He was born on March 8, 1841, in Boston. The cultural dominance of New England was at its height. The West was raw, great parts of it wilderness as yet only sketchily explored. A majority of the nation&apos;s citizens still considered the enslavement
                                                        of Negroes as the operation of a law of God, and Darwin had not yet published his &quot;Origin of Species.&quot;

                                                        The circumstances of his birth were fortunate. His father, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, was of New England&apos;s ruling caste and the atmosphere of his home was at once brahminical, scientific and literary. They boy was to start each day at that &quot;autocratic&quot;

                                                        The boy was prepared for Harvard by E. S. Dixwell of Cambridge. He was fortunate again in this. Well-tutored, he made an excellent record in college. His intimacy with Mr. Dixwell&apos;s household was very close. His tutor&apos;s daughter, Fanny Dixwell,
                                                        and he fell in love with each other and later they were married.

Young Holmes, 20 years old and shortly to be graduated from Harvard with the class of &apos;61, walked down Beacon Hill with an open Hobbe&apos;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; in his
                                                        hand and learned that he was commissioned in the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers.

There were grave tactical errors and the Union troops were driven down the cliff on
                                                        the Virginia shore and into the Potomac. Men trying to swim to safety were killed and wounded men were drowned.

The search lasted many worried days and brought the father close to the lines at several points. He found his
                                                        son already convalescent and brought him back to Boston, where he wrote his experiences under the title, &quot;My Hunt for the Captain,&quot; an article that was enthusiastically received as bringing
                                                        home to Boston a first-hand picture of the trials of war directly behind the lines.

He had been class poet and prize essayist in college. But he finally turned to law, although it was long before he was
                                                        sure that he had taken the best course.

Through long nights they discussed their &quot;dilapidated old friend the Kosmos.&quot; James later was
                                                        to write in affectionate reminiscence of &quot;your whitely lit-up room, drinking in your profound wisdom, your golden jibes, your costly imagery, listening to your shuddering laughter.&quot;

                                                        he drove deep into the study of the law.

Early in 1867 he was admitted to the bar and James noted that &quot;Wendell is working too hard.&quot; The hard work brought results. In 1870 he was made editor of the American Law

                                                        In a dissenting opinion written early in his career on the Supreme bench Justice Holmes bluntly told his associates that the case in hand had been decided by the majority on an economic theory which a large part of the country did not entertain, that
                                                        general principles do not decide concrete cases, that the outcome depends on a judgment or institution more subtle than any articulate major premise.

                                                        A great struggle between the forces of Theodore Roosevelt and the elder J. P. Morgan began on March 10, 1902, when the government filed suit in the United States Circuit Court for the district of Minnesota charging that the Great Northern Securities Company
                                                        was &quot;a virtual consolidation of two competing transcontinental lines&quot; whereby not only would &quot;monopoly of the interstate and foreign commerce, formerly carried on by them as competitors,
                                                        be created,&quot; but, through use of the same machinery, &quot;the entire railway systems of the country may be absorbed, merged, and consolidated.&quot;

                                                        In April, 1903, the lower court decided for the government and 8,000 pages of records and briefs went to the United States Supreme Court for final review. On March 14, 1904, the high court found for the government, with Justice Holmes writing in dissent.

                                                        He held that the Sherman act did not prescribe the rule of &quot;free competition among those engaged in interstate commerce,&quot; as the majority held. It merely forbade &quot;restraint of trade or commerce.&quot; He asserted that the phrases &quot;restraint
                                                        of competition&quot; and &quot;restraint of trade&quot; did not have the same meaning; that &quot;restraint of trade,&quot; which had &quot;a definite and well-established significance in the common
                                                        law, means and had always been understand to mean, a combination made by men engaged in a certain business for the purpose of keeping other men out of that business * * *.&quot;

                                                        The objection to trusts was not the union of former competitors, but the sinister power exercised, or supposed to be exercised, by the combination in keeping rivals out of the business, he said. It was the ferocious extreme of competition with others,
                                                        not the cessation of competition among the partners, which was the evil feared.

The court below argued as if maintaining competition were the express purpose of the
                                                        act. The act says nothing about competition.&quot;

                                                        It was at this time that John Morley visited America and returned to England with the affirmation that in Justice Homes America possessed the greatest judge of the English- speaking world. Time has reinforced the emphasis. In his years on the Supreme
                                                        Court bench he had done more to mold the texture of the Constitution than any man since John Marshall revealed to the American people what their new Constitution might imply.

Excerpts From Holmes&apos;s Writings</b></p>

                                                        From the opinions and other writings of Justice Holmes the following lines are some that might be used for this test:
                                                    </p>

                                                        test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried out. That, at any rate,
                                                        is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.&quot;

But to gather the streams from waste and to draw
                                                        from them energy, labor without brains, and so to save mankind from toil that it can be spared, is to supply what, next to intellect, is the very foundation of all our achievements and all our welfare.
                                                        If that purpose is not public, we should be at a loss to say what is.&quot;

                                                        disagree. Considerable latitude must be allowed for difference of view as well as for possible peculiar conditions which this court can know but imperfectly, if at all. Otherwise a Constitution,

He lived as he advised others to live, in the &quot;grand manner.&quot; He sought quality rather than quantity of experience and knowledge of his success in living helped others to find it,

                                                        Justice Holmes resigned on Jan. 12, 1932. &quot;The time has now come and I bow to the inevitable,&quot; he wrote to the President. He left, amid national regret, almost thirty years after he had been appointed to the Supreme Court bench.
