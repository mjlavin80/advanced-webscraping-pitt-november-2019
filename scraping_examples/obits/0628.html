                                                    <p>Richard Rodgers, the world renowned composer and lyricist, died at his East Side home in Manhattan at 10:28 P.M. last night after a long illness. He was 77 years old. A spokesman for the family said
                                                        funeral services would be private.</p>

                                                        of Broadway: &quot;Music by Richard Rodgers.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>The phrase connoted the seemingly endless flow of wonderfully singable, danceable melodies that poured out of Mr. Rodgers. And coupled with the names of his two principal lyricists, Lorenz Hart and Oscar

                                                        to be cynical, where Oscar never was. Oscar was more sentimental and so the music had to be more sentimental. It wouldn&apos;t have been natural for Larry to write &apos;Oklahoma!&apos; any more
                                                        than it would have been natural for Oscar to write &apos;Pal Joey.&apos;&quot;

                                                        Though his work with Mr. Hart and Mr. Hammerstein was highly successful, his contributions to the growth of musical comedy were particularly marked in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership.

                                                    <p>To the untutored, Mr. Rodgers seemed to be able to compose instantaneously, an impression that was created by stories about how he wrote tunes over breakfast (he once did that) and by Mr. Lerner&apos;s
                                                        account of telephoning Mr. Rodgers with a suggested title of having him call back within five minutes with a whole tune.</p>

                                                        who liked to sing Broadway operettas at home, Richard learned to pick out tunes with one finger on the piano when he was 4 years old. He composed his first song--&quot;Auto Show Girl&quot;--when
                                                        he was 14, his first musical comedy--a Columbia student show-- at 17, his first hit show--The Garrick Gaieties&quot;--when he was 23.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hart met in 1918. They liked each other immediately, and quickly developed fondness and respect. &quot;Larry Hart,&quot; his partner recalled, &quot;was a genius at lyric construction,
                                                        at rhyming, at finding the offbeat way of expressing himself.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;He had a somewhat sardonic view of the world that can be found occasionally in his love songs and in his satirical numbers. But Larry was also a kind, gentle, generous little guy. Working with
                                                        him, however, did present problems since he had to be literally trapped into putting pen to paper--and then only after hearing a melody that stimulated him,&quot; Mr. Rodgers said.

They had a middling success with &quot;Poor Little Ritz Girl&quot; in 1920 and then five years of dross, during which Mr. Rodgers studied under Walter

                                                    <p>Shortly after &quot;By Jupiter&quot; in 1942, the Theater Guild asked Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hart to do a musical version of Lynn Rigg&apos;s &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs.&quot; However, Mr. Hart was beset
                                                        by illness (he died in 1943), and Mr. Rodgers sought out Mr. Hammerstein, a friend of many years, to collaborate on what became &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;

                                                    <p>Compared to Mr. Hart, Mr. Hammerstein brought a wholly different personality to the collaborative effort. Mr. Rodgers once wrote:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Oscar Hammerstein&apos;s view of life was more positive, more optimistic. He had a wonderful family. He was a joiner, a leader, a man willing to do battle for whatever causes he believed in. .
                                                        . . He was as meticulous a craftsman as Larry, and he was extremely versatile. As a partner, he was completely dependable.

                                                        &quot;As far as his work with me was concerned, Oscar always wrote about the things that affected him deeply. What was truly remarkable was his never-ending ability to find new ways of revealing how he felt about three interrelating themes--nature, music
                                                        and love.

                                                        just about everything Oscar felt about nature and music and love was summed up in the title song.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>When &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; opened March 31, 1943, the critics discerned a marvelous blend of well- integrated dialogue, lyrics, music and dancing drawn from native American sources that told a believable
                                                        story. &quot;While the songs fit the period of 1900 perfectly in mood and character,&quot; wrote Howard Barnes in The Herald Tribune, &quot;they are in no sense derivative. It is strictly a Rodgers
                                                        score and an extraordinarily varied and beautiful one.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>Olin Downes, The New York Times music critic, found that &quot;the music is not folk music, but that of a Broadway composer writing in popular vein, free, skillfully and with taste, and a fortunate relinquishment
                                                        of the jazzeries of previous fashion.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>The musical ran for five years--2,212 performances. In that period, two million copies of its sheet music were sold and more than 500,000 albums of the cast recording. Its backers received a 25-to-1
                                                        return on their investment. Revivals, and there were scores of them, added to this figure. The latest revival of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; opened at the Palace Theater just a few weeks ago, on Dec. 13.</p>

                                                    <p>While the original &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was packing the St. James Theater, Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein wrote &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1945 and &quot;Allegro&quot; in 1947. At the same time they entered
                                                        the producing field with &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; in 1945 and followed with &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,&quot; for which Irving Berlin wrote the music and lyrics.</p>

                                                        Perhaps the greatest success of the Rodgers and Hammerstein combination was &quot;South Pacific,&quot; the first musical of their joint authorship that they themselves produced in association with Leland Hayward and Joshua Logan, who did some of the libretto.
                                                        Opening at the Majestic Theater April 7, 1949, it ran for 1,925 performances, while a national company toured the country for five years. In addition, it was made into a movie and revived innumerable

                                                        in 1959.</p>
                                                    <p>In the period of his two collaborations, Mr. Rodgers also discovered the time to compose 13 hours of music for &quot;Victory at Sea,&quot; a television show for the Navy; the score for &quot;Winston

                                                        for &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; in 1965--but without the grand successes he had achieved in previous years.

                                                        to mixed reviews in 1970, a production based on the Clifford Odets play retelling the Genesis story of Noah and the Ark. It had lyrics by Martin Charnin and Danny Kaye in the starring role.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Rex,&quot; a musical about Henry VIII of England, got an icy reception from critics in 1974. It had lyrics by Sheldon Harnick and a book by Sherman Yellen. There were Broadway revivals of &quot;Pal

                                                        as a straight play in 1945, returned to Broadway with music by Mr. Rodgers and words by Martin Charnin.
