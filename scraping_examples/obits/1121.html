                                                    <h5>By JOHN S. WILSON</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Coleman Hawkins, the tenor saxophonist who, with such musicians as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton, was one of the pioneer shapers of Jazz, died yesterday at Wickersham Hospital. Mr. Hawkins, who suffered from a liver ailment, was
                                                        64 years old. He lived at 445 West 153d Street.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        During Mr. Hawkins&apos;s career, which spanned almost half a century, he created the first valid jazz style on the tenor saxophone, influenced countless saxophonists and was in the vanguard of jazz development.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There were saxophonists in jazz bands before Mr. Hawkins began to develop his manner of playing in the mid-1920&apos;s. But they were using a slap-tongue effect, which resulted in a chickenlike sound, reflecting the prevalent feeling that the saxophone
                                                        was essentially a comic instrument. Mr. Hawkins, who had been using this technique himself, found and developed resources in the saxophone while he was in Fletcher Henderson&apos;s Orchestra at Roseland
                                                        Ballroom between 1924 and 1927.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He used a big tone and a heavy vibrato. His swaggering attack drove along relentlessly through intensely rhythmic, choppy phrases.
                                                    </p>

Developing the Sound

                                                        &quot;I always did play with a kind of stiff reed,&quot; he said in explaining the basis of his early style. &quot;When I started, I also used to play very loud because I was trying to play over seven or eight other horns all the time. I used to work
                                                        on those reeds all night to make them sound. Having to play loud developed the fullness of my sound.&quot;

                                                        The power with which Mr. Hawkins played his saxophone was vividly recalled by Rex Stewart, the cornetist, who once received an emergency call to fill in with the Henderson band after two trumpet players were injured in an accident. One of those injured
                                                        was the first trumpet. En route to the job, Mr. Stewart wondered who had been called in to play the first trumpet part.</p>

                                                        volume such as I had never heard coming out of a tenor sax.&quot;

                                                        Many of the saxophonists who were initially influenced by Mr. Hawkins during this period never went beyond that influence. Mr. Hawkins, however, continued to develop.

                                                        In 1939 he made a recording of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; that still stands as a classic model of welding grace and strength in a jazz ballad. And in the 1950&apos;s, he removed some of the earlier heaviness from his tone and used silence as an element
                                                        in his solos along with rough ascending and descending runs.</p>

For the first time, the emotion beneath the surface of his solos became steadily
                                                        visible and once in a while it backed up and burst through.&quot;

Shuffling out on the stage in a grandfatherly manner, he gave the impression that he could scarcely hold up his saxophone. The first few tentative sounds he blew seemed to confirm that.
                                                        Then, as his solo began to develop, he appeared to grow in stature as the notes he produced gained in authority and his performance took on the power and individuality that had always characterized

                                                        Mr. Hawkins was born in St. Joseph, Mo., on Nov. 21, 1904. His mother, an organist, started teaching him piano when he was 5. At 7, he was studying cello and when he was 9 he got a saxophone. He studied harmony, counterpoint and composition at Washburn
                                                        College in Topeka, Kan., and at 17, he joined Mamie Smith&apos;s Jazz Hounds, a group that accompanied Miss Smith, a vaudeville singer, at the 12th Street Theater in Kansas City.

                                                    </p>

                                                        &quot;He read everything. And he didn&apos;t--as was the custom then--play the saxophone like a trumpet or a clarinet. He was running changes because he&apos;d studied the piano as a youngster.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Hawkins reached New York with the Jazz Hounds in 1922 and made his first recording then with Miss Smith. Fletcher Henderson heard him playing at jam sessions, used him on several recordings accompanying blues singers and added him to the band that
                                                        he took into the Club Alabam in 1923. Mr. Hawkins remained with the Henderson band for 11 years, playing most of the time at the Roseland Ballroom. He worked constantly on his style and technique.

The saxophonist toured in England, France and the Netherlands, and when the threat of World War II developed in 1939, he with several other American jazz musicians,
