Domesticity and the Macabre
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Shirley Jackson wrote in two styles. She could describe the delights and turmoils of ordinary domestic life with detached hilarity; and she could, with cryptic symbolism, write a tenebrous horror story in the Gothic mold in which abnormal behavior seemed
                                                        perilously ordinary.

                                                        In either genre, she wrote with remarkable tautness and economy of style, and her choice of words and phrases was unerring in building a story&apos;s mood.

                                                        The dark and sinister story, opening on a quiet note, describes with mounting suspense, an annual village lottery to select a ritual victim to be put to death by stoning. The excitement is all in the selection of the woman&apos;s name from slips of paper
                                                        in a black box.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The stoning itself is dispassionately cold-blooded. The magazine received hundreds of letters, virtually all of them demanding to know what the tale meant.

Housework Came First

                                                    <p>
                                                        Was the stoning a parable of institutionalized fury? Was it an exposition of the cruelty of conformity? Was it a statement of the fundamental baseness of man? Or was it just a good chiller?
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        No one could say for certain. But other stories and novels of a similar kind gave the impression that Miss Jackson was at bottom a moralist who was saying that cruel and lustful conduct is not far below the surface in those who count themselves normal
                                                        and respectable, and that society can act with inquisitorial torture against individuals it finds odd. The harmless eccentric, Miss Jackson appeared to say, could be damned and killed with the ferocity
                                                        usually reserved for overt social enemies.

                                                        Because Miss Jackson wrote so frequently about ghosts and witches and magic, it was said that she used a broomstick for a pen. But the fact was that she used a typewriter--and then only after she had completed her household chores.

It&apos;s great fun and I love it. For one thing,
                                                        it&apos;s the only way I can get to sit down.&quot;

                                                        Miss Jackson believed in magic--both white and black--but looked deceptively tranquil and maternal. If one were looking for the witch in her, there was, of course, the broomstick that she wielded about the house and an assortment of black cats that sometimes
                                                        numbered six.

                                                        For all the disorganization and anticness with which Miss Jackson liked to invest her household and herself, she was in true life a neat and cozy woman whose blue eyes looked at the world through light horn-rimmed spectacles. She was 5 feet 6 inches tall
                                                        and inclined to pudginess. But the most notable thing about her was a voice full of laughter.

                                                    <p>
                                                        This sense of merriment came through in two books that dealt with her family life in North Bennington, where she had lived in an old and noisy house with her husband and four rambunctious children. These books were &quot;Life Among the Savages&quot; (1953)
                                                        and &quot;Raising Demons&quot; (1957).</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Deftly and artfully, Miss Jackson told of the perpetual pandemonium and the constant crises that accompany growing up. The mother, it seemed, was always the heroine. Orville Prescott, The New York Times critic, said that he had read &quot;Life Among the
                                                        Savages&quot; &quot;until I laughed so much the tears came to my eyes and I had to stop.&quot;</p>

                                                        Miss Jackson&apos;s sketches of domesticity were officially classified as nonfiction, but it is evident from a reading that their author could not resist embellishing a good story. The fiction, on the other hand, was an unburnished exercise in the sinister,
                                                        which stemmed from her study of social anthropology and magic and her conviction that a witches&apos; brew could be a powerful libation.

                                                        be read as splendidly executed chill stories or as macabre commentary on human sanity.

In that novel (&quot;The

                                                        Shirley Jackson was born in San Francisco Dec. 14, 1919, the daughter of Leslie Hardie and Geraldine (Bugbee) Jackson. She passed her childhood on the coast and made it the subject of her first book, &quot;The Road Through the Wall&quot; (1948). She received
                                                        a Bachelor of Arts degree from Syracuse University in 1940, was married to Mr. Hyman the same year and moved to Vermont.
