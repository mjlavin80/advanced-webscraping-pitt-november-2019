                                                        family, Mrs. Aquino said she would leave it &apos;&apos;to others, and ultimately to history,&apos;&apos; to assess Mr. Marcos&apos;s rule, which &apos;&apos;touched the life of every Filipino who
                                                        was his contemporary.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> President Bush, in a statement issued at an education summit conference in Charlottesville, Va., commended Mr. Marcos for his exit from power in 1986 amid a popular uprising and pressure from the United
                                                        States Government after a disputed presidential election. By leaving the Philippines at &apos;&apos;a critical juncture in his nation&apos;s history,&apos;&apos; the White House statement said, Mr.
                                                        Marcos &apos;&apos;permitted the peaceful transition to popular, democratic rule.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Marcos&apos;s death was announced early this morning by his son, Ferdinand Jr., who emerged from the medical center&apos;s intensive care unit after reciting a rosary at his father&apos;s bedside,
                                                        along with his mother and his sister, Irene Araneta. </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;God has taken this great man from our midst to a better place,&apos;&apos; said the younger Marcos, 31 years old. &apos;&apos;Hopefully, friends and detractors alike will look beyond the
                                                        man to see what he stood for his vision, his compassion and his total love of country.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Marcos had been on the brink of death many times in his long hospitalization. A family spokesman, Roger Peyuan, said Mrs. Marcos had instructed doctors to take every possible step to save her husband&apos;s
                                                        life.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Tiwanak said Mr. Marcos&apos;s condition began deteriorating 36 hours before his death. He said a pacemaker was implanted about midday on Wednesday, &apos;&apos;and it appeared his functions were
                                                        coming back to some normalcy.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Tiwanak said the pacemaker was needed to keep Mr. Marcos&apos;s heart pumping but he also noted that because Mr. Marcos had &apos;&apos;multiple organ problems, any one of those could have gone completely.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Marcos had spent most of the time since he entered the hospital in intensive care. According to Mr. Tiwanak, doctors had said that &apos;&apos;if any one of the machines were pulled off he would have died.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Tiwanak said Mr. Marcos was semicomatose most of the time before the latest crisis. Mr. Peyuan, the family spokesman, said Mr. Marcos opened his eyes and recognized his son, who had flown here from California, shortly before he died.</p>
                                                    <b>Liver and Kidney Failure </b>
                                                    <p> There were several phases in Mr. Marcos&apos;s hospital stay when he appeared near death. In mid-May, he had surgery to prepare him for kidney dialysis. In early June, emergency exploratory surgery was
                                                        performed after an abscess was found in his pancreas. In mid-June, more surgery was performed to correct a bleeding stomach ulcer.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In late June, his liver failed and he had a 104-degree fever, but survived to undergo removal of his only functional kidney, which had been transplanted in 1984. Mr. Marcos became dependent on kidney
                                                        dialysis for survival. His prognosis was poor, but doctors treated him with a new antibiotic. On Sept. 3 his blood pressure dropped sharply.

                                                    <p> A Marcos aide, Col. Arturo Aruiza, said funeral plans were pending at the Nuuanu Memorial Park Mortuary. A family spokesman said the body would be on view at the family compound in Makiki Heights until
                                                        Sunday. There are no plans for burial of the body elsewhere, Colonel Aruiza said. Mrs. Marcos has said in the past that she intended to embalm her husband&apos;s body and display it in Hawaii while
                                                        she awaited permission to return to the Philippines.</p>

                                                        In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an order at the request of the State Department barring any aircraft with the body of Mr. Marcos from leaving Hawaii or any other point in the United States for the Philippines. The F.A.A. said
                                                        that &apos;&apos;such a return, or the attempt to do so, would create a danger to the safety of the aircraft and persons involved.&apos;&apos;

                                                        Mr. Marcos&apos;s mother, Josefa, died last May at the age of 91. Her body has not buried, because her son had insisted on presiding at the funeral. Her body is on display at a museum in the Marcos&apos;s home province of Ilocos Norte. </p>
                                                    <p> After Mr. Marcos&apos;s ouster from the Presidency, an inventory at Malacanang Palace in Manila found more than a thousand pairs of shoes belonging to Mrs. Marcos, 888 handbags, 71 pairs of sunglasses
                                                        and 65 parasols - part of a lavish inventory that shocked and offended the world more than any past estimates of the Marcos&apos;s enormous wealth.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Here in Honolulu, first in guest quarters at the Hickam Air Force Base and then in a hillside villa, Mrs. Marcos has entertained visitors with piano recitals, videos of her husband&apos;s presidential
                                                        speeches and photographs of the couple in the embrace of world leaders. She recently recorded an album of ballads and is reported to have sung at her husband&apos;s bedside when he was alert.

                                                    <p> Mr. Marcos, his wife and eight others were indicted in New York last year by a Federal grand jury on racketeering charges. In April, the judge separated Mr. Marcos from the other defendants because he
                                                        was too ill to stand trial.

                                                    <p> Mr. Marcos and nearly 100 members of his family and entourage arrived here in February 1986 aboard two United States Air Force jets. One carried passengers and the second had luggage and other personal
                                                        property that was seized by the United States Customs Service. The seized property was valued then at $8.2 million and a bitter fight over custody of the items still is being waged in the Federal
                                                        courts.

                                                        the initial payment was made through the family&apos;s lawyers several weeks ago. Mr. Tiwanak said the hospital has been in touch with the lawyers &apos;&apos;to make sure they keep a current payment.&apos;&apos;
