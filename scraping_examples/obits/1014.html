                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Military leadership of the victorious Allied forces in Western Europe during World War II invested Dwight David Eisenhower with an immense popularity, almost amounting to devotion, that twice elected him President of the United States. His enormous political
                                                        success was largely personal, for he was not basically a politician dealing in partisan issues and party maneuvers. What he possessed was a superb talent for gaining the respect and affection of
                                                        the voters as the man suited to guide the nation through cold war confrontations with Soviet power around the world and to lead the country to domestic prosperity.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Eisenhower&apos;s gift for inspiring confidence in himself perplexed some analysts because he was not a dashing battlefield general nor a masterly military tactician; apparently what counted most in his generalship also impressed the voters most: an ability
                                                        to harmonize diverse groups and disparate personalities into a smoothly functioning coalition.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Thus Eisenhower&apos;s two terms in the White House were a personal triumph in which he transcended the persons and forces around him. About his bewitching, benign and smiling figure there grew an aura of certain success that weathered shifts in his personal
                                                        popularity and began to wane only in the years after he left the Presidency.

                                                        Of all his unquestioned great moments, two stand out as landmarks. One is May 7, 1945, when Gen. Alfred Jodl, chief of the German Armed Forces Operations Staff, surrendered unconditionally to the Allies at a schoolhouse in Rheims, France, culminating
                                                        the European phase of a terrible conflict that had nearly consumed the world.

                                                        The other is Nov. 6, 1955, when Eisenhower was elected to a second term as President by one of the largest votes ever rolled up by a candidate of any party. His vote of 35.5 million has since been eclipsed, but it was a stunning performance at the time.

                                                        along moderate lines. In the campaign of 1964, however, he declined to use his prestige to block the nomination of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Moderates backing Gov. William W. Scranton of

Roosevelt was a patrician with a master&apos;s manner in handling men; Sir Winston Churchill was an aristocrat born to
                                                        command; Josef Stalin was a tyrant who ruled by ruthless craft; Nikita S. Khrushchev was a peasant&apos;s son given to hearty bluster; Harry S. Truman was a commoner who led because he was stubborn.

                                                        Eisenhower&apos;s political appeal, apart from the glory conferred by his military accomplishments, lay in his background and his expression of it. He was a product of Abilene, Kan., a small Middle Western town that did not have a paved street until 1910--
                                                        the year after his graduation from high school. He was also the product of a close-knit Mennonite German family that passed on to him the simple pieties of 19th-century agricultural America.

                                                        Insulated all of his adult life from the rise of industrialism and the anxieties of the job world by the institutional security of Army life, Eisenhower preserved these homilies virtually intact: God helps those who help themselves; the devil find mischief
                                                        for idle hands; do justice and you will receive justice; prosperity is a sign of divine blessing; a change of heart expiates sin.

Cloaked with
                                                        the power to command, he preferred to persuade and conciliate; he seemed to radiate goodwill and diplomacy. He was, in short, a man to be trusted, a man to make the complex simple, to do the job.

                                                        to think they themselves possessed, or should ideally possess.

Truman offered to assist the general if he wanted to seek the Presidency in 1948. &quot;Mr. President,&quot; he said, &quot;I don&apos;t know who will be your opponent for the Presidency, but it will

At the time he was on leave from the presidency of Columbia University to serve
                                                        as commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Europe.

In 1950, when the party resurgent in Congress, Thomas E. Dewey of New York, the titular leader, proposed Eisenhower as the nominee for 1952. Soon there was a
                                                        well-beaten path to Rocquencourt, outside Paris, where the general made his headquarters; it was trod by politicians and businessmen, many of whom assured him, with adroit flattery, of the public
                                                        clamor for him back home and of the ease with which he could get the nomination.

                                                        Having indicated that he would accept the party&apos;s designation, however, Eisenhower soon discovered that it was not quite his for the asking. Pitted against him was Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the &quot;Mr. Republican&quot; of the party&apos;s
                                                        conservative wing. The decisive issue between them, as the general saw it, was isolationism. Indeed, Eisenhower agreed to run after he was convinced that Taft would not commit himself to the principles
                                                        of NATO.

                                                        The struggle was close, and the general was obliged to do some campaigning. Up to the convention in July, 1952, the outcome was unresolved. With the party machinery in Taft&apos;s hands, the issue hinged on how delegate contests in Texas, Louisiana and
                                                        Georgia would be decided. In a maneuver that outwitted and discomfited the opposition, the Eisenhower forces, masterminded by Dewey, put across a &quot;fair play&quot; amendment to the rules that
                                                        restricted voting by contested delegations already seated. It swung control of the convention away from Taft and led to Eisenhower&apos;s nomination.

Other shifts eventually brought his total to 845 votes, while Taft slipped from a high of
                                                        500 to 280.

                                                        Eisenhower quickly moved to attain party unity by calling on Taft at his convention offices. Later the two had a dramatic breakfast meeting at Columbia University that brought Taft followers into line, for both agreed, in a communique, that they sought
                                                        similar foreign and domestic objectives.</p>

                                                        In the broadest terms, Eisenhower campaigned against his Democratic opponent, Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, on a pledge to clean up &quot;the mess in Washington&quot; and to balance the budget. Shortly before the election he promised he would personally
                                                        go to Korea and try to end the war there. In its day-to-day unfolding, however, the campaign was much akin to a popularity contest. The country was covered with &quot;I Like Ike&quot; buttons, placards
                                                        and posters; &quot;All the Way With Adlai&quot; was a fervent, but forlorn, cry.

In a dramatic television appeal to the nation, Nixon made a sweeping denial of wrongdoing, satisfying
                                                        Eisenhower&apos;s insistence that his running mate be &quot;clean as a hound&apos;s tooth.&quot; Accepting Nixon&apos;s version of the fund, Eisenhower exclaimed: &quot;That&apos;s my boy.&quot;

                                                        In the McCarthy episode, the general was persuaded to delete from a campaign speech a defense of General of the Army George C. Marshall, his Army mentor, whom Senator McCarthy had impugned as a traitor. Political advisers had told Eisenhower that he needed
                                                        McCarthy&apos;s support to win the election.

But the vote there, as elsewhere, was a personal tribute. The Republican edge in Congress was slight,
                                                        and it vanished altogether in 1954 and 1956, indicating how far, in the voter&apos;s minds, the general stood above party.

He had traveled to Korea, where a truce was soon effected, bringing back thousands of servicemen. At home the government climate
                                                        was benign and the press was friendly, even protective, as a seeming new era opened.

                                                        Oddly, Old Guard Republicans, long entrenched in Congress, were among the most vocal critics, because the first Republican Administration in 20 years did not make a clean break with the New and Fair Deals. The Old Guard objected when the Administration
                                                        eased credit, abandoned efforts to balance the budget and, in addition to letting $5-billion in Korean War taxes lapse, sanctioned a further tax reduction of $2.4-billion. On top of this, the Administration
                                                        put through an extension of insurance coverage under Social Security and accepted a minimum wage of $1 an hour, up from 75 cents.

Sherman Adams, a former New Hampshire Governor, headed the staff with the title &quot;The Assistant to the President.&quot;
                                                        Despite some initial creaking, the system worked smoothly, especially late in the fist term when the President was twice stricken with serious illness.

                                                        Eisenhower attached great importance to business success, a fact evident from the many representatives of big business named to his Cabinet and other key posts. It was a standing joke that his first Cabinet was composed of &quot;eight millionaires and
                                                        a plumber.&quot; Perhaps significantly, the first to depart was the plumber, Martin P. Durkin, who resigned within a year as Secretary of Labor. He said the President had reneged on a promise to
                                                        press for revision of the Taft-Hartley Act, which restricted the union shop.

Talbott--were subjected to Senatorial questioning on their investments and on possible conflicts of interest between their official and business
                                                        lives. Talbott, Secretary of the Air Force, later resigned over such charges.

                                                        Throughout, the President was irritated by suggestions that his policies favored business at the expense of other segments of the population. He firmly believed that what was good for business was good for the nation.

                                                        His contention seemed borne out by the economic boom that began in mid-1954 and continued through the rest of the first term. Because prosperous times followed a mild recession in 1953, tax concessions to business seemed all the more vindicated.

                                                        Under Eisenhower, the nation maintained its international leadership even if, at times, its course seemed uncertain and erratic. The Administration had high hopes that, with the Korean truce, psychological warfare would give the West an ascendancy in
                                                        the battle of ideologies. But when Stalin died in 1953, and again when revolt flared three years later in Hungary and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain, there was no master plan ready to capitalize
                                                        on developments.

                                                        Yet Eisenhower&apos;s atoms-for-peace proposal made before the United Nations in 1953, and his open skies inspection plan, presented at the summit conference in Geneva in 1955, contributed markedly toward relaxation of world tensions and a more hopeful
                                                        outlook.

Bulganin, French Premier Edgar Faure and British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, never fully materialized, the meeting did produce a tacit understanding that
                                                        nuclear war would be avoided.

                                                        The neutral and nonaligned powers, notably India, liked Eisenhower&apos;s thinking in these areas. This was significant because other policies of this nation perturbed the neutrals. They did not agree that the cause of peace was being served by the ring
                                                        of defensive alliances drawn around the Soviet bloc on the United States initiative. Among these was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an alliance set up late in 1954 upon French withdrawal
                                                        from Indochina.

                                                        At that time Eisenhower also wrote a letter to the Diem Government of South Vietnam, vaguely pledging United States economic and arms assistance. That letter, scarcely noticed at the time, was later used to justify massive American military involvement
                                                        in Vietnam.

                                                        Although an uneasy detente existed in Europe, tension prevailed in the Orient, especially between the Peoples Republic of China and the Nationalist regime on Taiwan. This reached a high point in 1955, when the Communists seemed ready to strike at the
                                                        offshore island. In a dramatic step, Eisenhower asked Congress to underwrite his authority to use American armed force &quot;if necessary to assure the security&quot; of Taiwan.

                                                        In some areas the United States found itself in trade-and-aid competition with the Soviet Union. Middle East developments in 1955 pointed up the extent of this rivalry. The West, jolted by an Egyptian arms purchase from the Soviet bloc, was drawn into
                                                        the bidding to finance the Aswan High Dam that the United Arab Republic wanted to build on the Nile. Midway in 1956 the West pulled out of the bidding and in a matter of days the U.A.R. seized the
                                                        Suez Canal.

After Israeli forces entered Egypt, Britain and France threatened on Oct. 30, 1956, to intervene if the fighting was not
                                                        halted promptly. With world attention divided between the Mideast and Hungary, in the throes of upheaval, the U.A.R. balked, and Anglo-French forces took action. The conflict was speedily taken to
                                                        the United Nations, where, in the voting for a cease-fire, the United States sided with the Soviet Union against France and Britain.

It sent the President to the hospital for seven weeks. The second occurred eight and a half months later, on June 8, 1956, and was diagnosed as ileitis,
                                                        an inflammation of the lower part of the small intestine. Eisenhower underwent a successful operation the next day to bypass the ileum, which was obstructing the intestinal tract.

Doud, from a four-day fishing trip in the Rockies. After complaining of indigestion and intense chest pain, he
                                                        was taken to the Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Denver. Heart specialists were called in, including Dr. Paul Dudley White of Boston, who described the attack as &quot;moderate.&quot; The patient was
                                                        cleared to leave the hospital Nov. 10, and he flew to Washington the following day, &quot;happy that the doctors have given me a parole if not a pardon.&quot;

In these tasks he was aided by Vice President Nixon as well as by Sherman Adams.
                                                        Despite the smoothness with which the President made decisions and despite the general uneventfulness of his recovery, speculation arose on his availability for a second term.

They unanimously favored a second term, telling him it was his duty to continue working for peace if his health permitted. This advice led
                                                        to Eisenhower&apos;s announcement on Feb. 29, 1956, that he would run again.

The Republicans renominated him
                                                        along with Nixon as his running mate.

He made a limited number of radio and television speeches and undertook only two campaign swings that kept him away from
