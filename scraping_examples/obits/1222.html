                                                    <p> Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930&apos;s, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930&apos;s and 40&apos;s. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950&apos;s
                                                        and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first

                                                        and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown,&quot; based on Paul Scott&apos;s &quot;Raj Quartet.&quot; </p>
                                                    <p> She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain&apos;s top film and television
                                                        awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London&apos;s major theatrical prize, for lifetime

to Remember 
</b>
                                                    <p> Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare&apos;s young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation,
                                                        artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and
                                                        Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter
                                                        and Beckett.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett&apos;s &quot;Happy Days,&quot; she was required to spend the first half of
                                                        the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It&apos;s &quot;the greatest part ever written,&quot; she said, &quot;nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and
                                                        like climbing Everest to perform.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. &quot;Acting,&quot; she said in 1985, &quot;is a mysterious business, so complicated,
                                                        so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively.&quot;

                                                        affectation.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress&apos;s &quot;shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality.&quot; The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an &quot;extraordinary
                                                        immediacy and passionate naivete.&quot; Harold Pinter said, &quot;This flame of life she possesses informs all she does.&quot; </p>

                                                        Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s 1935 thriller, &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; as a farmer&apos;s wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).

                                                        In making films she missed the theater&apos;s long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, &quot;is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p> She said appearing in films was &quot;instant acting&quot; because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. &quot;Also, you&apos;re in the hands
                                                        of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how,&quot; she said. &quot;And, of course, there&apos;s no sharing with an audience, no rapport.&quot;

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, &quot;I&apos;m not interested in myself, very.&quot; But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home
                                                        or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.
