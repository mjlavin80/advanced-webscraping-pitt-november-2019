                                                        a political rift within the NATO alliance that Mr. Brezhnev obviously sought to exploit.

In this area, despite their recognition of the crisis, the aging Soviet leaders made no effective attempt to reform the rigidities of centralized economic
                                                        planning. And as the standard of living declined, political repression increased. Dissidents, who had emerged openly in the mid-1970&apos;s to criticize violations of human rights, were later harassed
                                                        until most had either left the country or were in prison camps by the early 1980&apos;s. Soviet Jews, who had been permitted to emigrate by the thousands a month in 1977 and 1978, found that by 1982
                                                        permission to emigrate was virtually impossible to get. </p>
                                                    <p> In his last years, Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s speech became labored and his features pale and bloated, apparently as a result of medical treatments for a disability that was never publicly revealed. At the

                                                        and often joked about his excessive cigarette smoking, which was thought to have aggravated his health problems.

                                                        Ultimately he had to give up smoking altogether. </p>

Long Part of Coalition </b>

                                                        Mr. Brezhnev was long part of a coalition in the ruling Politburo of his party&apos;s Central Committee. Two other members of the coalition who for years were most visible to the West were Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin, who died in December 1980,
                                                        and President Nikolai V. Podgorny, who was ousted from the leadership group in 1977.

                                                        from the leadership on Jan. 25, 1982, at the age of 79. </p>
                                                    <p> In the fall of 1970 Mr. Brezhnev emerged from his post as the party chief to become the personal ambassador for detente. This occurred in his first meeting with Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany

                                                        including an American boycott of the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and the imposition of trade restrictions by the United States and other Western countries; Mr. Brezhnev criticized these steps as a return
                                                        to the cold war, but never acknowledged the Soviet Union&apos;s responsibility for provoking them.

                                                        Union and People&apos;s China were united by bonds of friendship and comradely cooperation,&apos;&apos; he said. Negotiations with the Chinese did resume in the fall of 1982, and Mr. Brezhnev, in
                                                        a speech to an audience of Soviet generals shortly afterward, said that while the prospects of a real improvement in relations were slim, the Soviet Union had an interest in pressing for them. </p>

                                                        under Mr. Khrushchev - accomplished much for the Soviet Union. </p>

The most recent
                                                        tightening came in 1981 in response to stiffening Western positions over the intervention in Afghanistan.

                                                        lift emigration barriers because this might be construed as bowing to external pressures, and the United States could not do less than insist, owing to its domestic pressures. </p>

In the Middle East, the Soviet Union supported Arab nationalism
                                                        with arms and technical experts and carried on a campaign to discredit Israel. Syria and Iraq were among the main beneficiaries of Soviet backing.

                                                        by the United States. At about the same time, he cemented Moscow&apos;s ties with the new pro-Soviet regime in Afghanistan by signing a 20-year treaty of friendship and cooperation, binding the two

                                                        But the cohesion among Moscow&apos;s allies in Eastern Europe came under strain - more even perhaps than occurred over Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 - as the rise of the Solidarity trade
                                                        union movement in Poland in 1980 fostered a wide-ranging liberalization of Polish life that ended in December 1981 with the imposition of martial law. </p>
                                                    <b> Chinese-Soviet Dispute</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        With China, Mr. Brezhnev maintained strictly correct relations at the governmental level while hurling anathemas against the Peking leadership, both in the last decade of Mao Zedong&apos;s life and under Mao&apos;s successors. For a long time, the Chinese-Soviet
                                                        dispute was both doctrinal and territorial, and it involved a struggle for hegemony over nationalist and revolutionary forces in the third world. Soviet policy toward the Chinese fluctuated in response
                                                        to changes in the situation.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> At first, Mr. Brezhnev made a number of efforts to convoke a congress of adherents to Moscow&apos;s version of Communism that would read China out of the world Communist movement, but he was unable to
                                                        gather a sufficiently impressive alignment.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>This failure was ascribed partly to an underlying distaste among Communists, even in the Soviet Union, to a formal splitting of the Communist movement; partly to Peking&apos;s stature in strategic areas
                                                        of the third world, and partly to hope among substantial segments of pro-Moscow Communists that the Soviet Union and China could ultimately be reconciled.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The confrontation never escalated to the point of war. When China invaded Vietnam early in 1979, Mr. Brezhnev duly warned Peking to halt its &apos;&apos;brazen bandit attack,&apos;&apos; but the statement
                                                        was relatively subdued in tone. Tentative moves to improve relations betweeen the two countries followed; at the same time, Vietnam fell clearly into the Soviet sphere of influence.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s power within the Soviet Union derived from his position as the head of the ruling party rather than from his assumption of the nation&apos;s presidency - for the second time - in
                                                        1977. In the gradual loosening of the Soviet system of one-man rule, Mr. Brezhnev was not, however, the single dominant leader, as Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev had been, and he sought, not always
                                                        successfully, to reduce many of the trappings of &apos;&apos;the cult of personality&apos;&apos; that Stalin and then Khrushchev had nurtured.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Because Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s power was more circumscribed than that of his predecessors, he was obliged to come to terms with often competing interests.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Careful Arms Negotiator </b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the groups that Mr. Brezhnev had to take into account was the military establishment. Like their counterparts in Western countries, Soviet military leaders tended to favor large budgets, impressive displays of weaponry and conservative mentalities.
                                                        But the Soviet leader was never so much at odds with his &apos;&apos;militaryindustrial complex&apos;&apos; as some Western politicians and analysts thought and hoped. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the slow-moving negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms, Mr. Brezhnev bargained carefully with American Presidents, constantly checking during the negotiations with other Politburo members, including the representatives of the military. He
                                                        always seemed careful to move in tandem with the military on all significant policy issues. </p>
                                                    <p> On the other hand, Mr. Brezhnev, by wheeling and dealing (how was never made public), altered the complexion of the Politburo over the years so that he was able to accumulate a large measure of personal
                                                        power without arousing his colleagues&apos; fears of a return to one-man rule. Shortly after the collective leadership was installed in 1964, he neutralized Aleksandr N. Shelepin, an ambitious Politburo
                                                        member, by shifting him from control of the security police to the trade union leadership.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        And in December 1965, he persuaded Mr. Podgorny to yield a key party secretary&apos;s post to become chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a ceremonial post equivalent to that of President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mr. Podgorny
                                                        was to hold the presidency for 12 years until Mr. Brezhnev himself assumed that post in addition to the party leadership.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In 1971 four new men, all Brezhnev supporters, were elected to the Politburo. And two years later he eased out Pyotr Y. Shelest and Gennadi I. Voronov, both considered opponents of detente. Despite this
                                                        seeming majority in the Politburo, which was further consolidated in subsequent years, Mr. Brezhnev was subject to scrutiny on such matters as the performance of the economy, the size of the grain
                                                        harvest, corruption in the party machinery and the development of Siberia. In addition, of course, the detente policy was examined from time to time in terms of specific Soviet advantages, political
                                                        and commercial.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> One of Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s dreams was to oversee the rapid development of Siberia with the aid of outside credits and technology. Blocked by United States reluctance to commit substantial capital to
                                                        the venture, he turned increasingly to Western Europe and Japan for partners in Siberian development projects.</p>
                                                    <b> Projected Air of Realism </b>
                                                    <p> The ebullience Mr. Brezhnev displayed abroad or to foreign visitors was in contrast to his staid and conservative deportment in Soviet public life. There he was very much the Communist in the gray flannel
                                                        suit, proper and formal and serious. The air he projected was one of realism, calmness and stability.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> He was not much in the public view, except on ceremonial occasions. Nonetheless, there seemed to be a conscious effort to humanize him in official photographs that showed him, for example, in shirtsleeve
                                                        talks with Chancellor Brandt of West Germany, greeting women factory workers in Yugoslavia with a kiss on the lips, hoisting up young children in Poland, or wearing dark glasses and an opennecked

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Although Mr. Brezhnev appeared to enjoy the limelight, he was careful to let a share fall on his principal colleagues. Both Mr. Kosygin and - while he was President - Mr. Podgorny journeyed abroad from
                                                        time to time, and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, who was elevated to Politburo membership under Mr. Brezhnev, remained the principal Soviet spokesman abroad.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s attitude toward expressions of dissent in the Soviet Union was firm. A number of intellectuals, artists and scientists opposed the Kremlin&apos;s ideological policies in whole or
                                                        in part, and there was restiveness among Soviet youth.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Outspoken dissidents in the Brezhnev years often found themselves committed to prison, mental institutions or deprived of their jobs. Some were deported to the West, notably Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the novelist. Those who remained, including Andrei
                                                        D. Sakharov, were denounced as lacking in socialist consciousness, which meant a refusal to place their talents at the disposal of the ruling ideology.</p>

                                                    <p> As Mr. Brezhnev described his views a couple of years ago: &apos;&apos;People who fall for self-publicity, ready to make a name for themselves not through work for the homeland but by any politically
                                                        dubious means - and not disdaining to praise our ideological opponents - sometimes fall into their net. The Soviet public harshly denounces the abominable deeds of these double-dealers.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev left the formulation of ideology to others, chiefly Mr. Suslov, the party ideologist and Politburo member whose close association with the party leader grew in the years after the ouster
                                                        of Mr. Khrushchev in 1964. Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s speeches were often more pragmatic than ideological, although earlier he had studded his remarks with Marxist references to the decline and corruption
                                                        of capitalism. But he avoided the flourishes that were associated with Mr. Khrushchev, who once promised &apos;&apos;to bury capitalism.&apos;&apos; Nor did Mr. Brezhnev contend, as his predecessor
                                                        did, that the Soviet Union would become a wonderland of material satisfactions while the United States and other capitalist societies were developing into wastelands for their citizens.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev and his colleagues displayed some uncertainties in handling Soviet public opinion, especially regarding Stalinism. Whereas Mr. Khrushchev had pursued a clear-cut policy of de-Stalinization
                                                        after denouncing Stalin&apos;s excesses in l956, the Brezhnev group tempered the policy on the ground that it was undermining the authority and unity of the Communist system. </p>
                                                    <p> The Stalin issue, with which the Soviet Union has not come fully to terms, was hushed up, but a nostalgia for some aspects of Stalin&apos;s rule was permitted to revive. His leadership in World War II
                                                        was occasionally mentioned; his face reappeared on movie screens; and his bust was mounted on his grave behind the Lenin Mausoleum in Red Square.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The memory of Mr. Khrushchev was, on the contrary, long drowned in official silence. The anniversaries of his death were not noted, nor was his regime recalled in panegyrics.

                                                    <p> But Mr. Brezhnev, in reminiscences published in November 1978 in the Soviet magazine Novy Mir, gave Mr. Khrushchev some credit as an administrator of agricultural policy - although he also described
                                                        him as having been petulant, stubborn and apt to use strong language.

In recent years, however, he appeared to accept greater deference as due his position as both the nation&apos;s President
                                                        and the party&apos;s chief.

                                                        his hat, waved and smiled in response. Mr. Kosygin and others looked at the throng but refrained from responding to its acclaim.

                                                        jokes about the Soviet leader, most of them unflattering.

                                                    <p> Once at a circus performance, women performers in scanty costumes presented him with bouquets of flowers. He thanked the first few with kisses. Then a few more. And then he made certain that those at
                                                        the rear were not omitted, for they, too, received hearty, full-faced busses. Finally, he donned his glasses and settled back to watch the performance, with the pleasure of one who finds a circus
                                                        more entertaining than the ballet or an opera.

                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s broad face with its dominating eyebrows often lost some of its impassivity at cocktail parties, once he could down an impressive number of cognacs or straight vodkas. In the last
                                                        few years, though, he was under physicians&apos; orders to cut down on drinking.

On a visit to Iran in 1963, after toasting a seemingly endless list of worthy objectives,
                                                        he lifted his vodka glass to exclaim: &apos;&apos;Down with protocol! Long live freedom!&apos;&apos;

                                                        In some private conversations he displayed a certain candor. In 1963, while talking with Glenn T. Seaborg, then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, he conceded that most Soviet buildings were hideous and suggested that the Soviet Union
                                                        might profit by sending some of its young architects abroad to study.

                                                        one of the finest collections of live birds in Moscow. He had an interest in agriculture and land reclamation.

                                                        Before his rise to eminence as Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s protege, Mr. Brezhnev was not conspicuous in Soviet life. Of Great Russian parentage, he was born Dec. 19, 1906, in Kamenskoye, now Dneprodzerzhinsk, in the Ukraine. His father was a steelworker. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The boy began his working life at 15 in the local steel mill. Starting in 1923, he went to school nights and was graduated four years later from a land survey and reclamation school in Kursk.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In this period he joined the Komsomol, the Young Communist League, and at the age of 25 he was accepted as a member of the Communist Party. At the same time he entered the steel engineering school in
                                                        his hometown. He was graduated in 1935 and worked as an engineer for two years.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In May 1937 he was elected deputy mayor of Dneprodzerzhinsk, his first post in government. Having impressed party leaders with his abilities, he was promoted the following year to a party secretaryship
                                                        of Dnepropetrovsk Province at a time when Mr. Khrushchev headed the party in the Ukraine. Their friendship is believed to have begun at that time.

On his 60th birthday Soviet authorities reviewed his war record
                                                        and said: </p>

                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s wartime exploits were also romanticized and effusively praised in biographical articles that began appearing in the late 1970&apos;s. By then, he also carried to honorific title of
                                                        Marshal of the Soviet Union.

                                                    <p> Mr. Brezhnev&apos;s war experience was the foundation for his many friendships among Soviet military men, who were one of the chief sources of his later influence in party and government affairs.

                                                        Mr. Brezhnev, returning to civilian life in 1946, was named to a series of responsible party posts in the Ukraine, supervising postwar reconstruction, and was then brought to Moscow in 1950 for further seasoning in the Central Committee&apos;s secretariat.
                                                        </p>
                                                    <p> In the middle of 1950 he was sent to the Moldavian Republic as party leader, a post he held for two years. Simultaneously, he was elected a member of the national Central Committee and a candidate member
                                                        of its Presidium, as the Politburo was then called. He was also named a national secretary, a position he occupied until the death of Stalin in 1953. </p>
                                                    <p> When the party leadership was reorganized after the dictator&apos;s death, Mr. Brezhnev was dropped from the secretaryship and from the Presidium, apparently because he was not in the confidence of Vyacheslav
                                                        M. Molotov, Georgi M. Malenkov and others who took over from Stalin. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After a brief return to political work in the Ministry of Defense as the chief political commissar of the armed forces, Mr. Brezhnev resumed his rise in the party hierarchy in July 1957, when Mr. Khrushchev ousted some of his rivals from the leadership.

                                                        For his loyalty to Mr. Khrushchev, Mr. Brezhnev was rewarded with the leadership of the republic of Kazakhstan. His job was to supervise Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s virgin lands project, which brought vast acreage into productive use. In two years 87 million
                                                        acres were placed under cultivation. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Brezhnev had proved the program a success, confounding experts who had forecast its failure. The project later ran into difficulties, but not until Mr. Brezhnev had earned a splendid reputation as an administrator, a man who could accomplish the impossible.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After being called back to Moscow, Mr. Brezhnev was made President of the Soviet Union in 1960, replacing Marshal Kliment Y. Voroshilov. As President, Mr. Brezhnev became a traveling saleman for the Soviet system, visiting Italy, North Korea, Finland,
                                                        Morocco, Guinea, Ghana, Yugoslavia and Iran. His travels and his friendship with Mr. Khrushchev convinced many observers that he was being groomed as the party leader&apos;s successor. </p>
                                                    <p> That speculation increased in 1963, when Mr. Brezhnev combined his job as President with that of second national secretary of the party, in charge of personnel selection. Then, in the summer of 1964,
                                                        he stepped down as President to devote full time to his party tasks.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Although there was no official bill of particulars, it became known that he had been ousted on accusations of bungling the Cuban missile crisis with the United States in 1962, mishandling the Soviet
                                                        rift with China, mismanaging the Soviet economy and supporting a cult of personality.

                                                    <p> Although he defended his policies, his removal from office by the Central Committee&apos;s Presidium was confirmed by the committee itself. In his stead the collective leadership of Mr. Brezhnev, Mr.
                                                        Kosygin and Mr. Podgorny took over.

                                                    <p>He seemed to lack stamina, to have become unable to put in the long work days that his position required, to be leaning more heavily than in the past on such aides as Konstantin U. Chernenko, who became
