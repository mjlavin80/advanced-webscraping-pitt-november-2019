                                                    <h5>By ROBERT F. KELLEY</h5>
                                                    <p>From his days as a player Knute Rockne made his influence felt on the trend of football. As captain of the 1913 Notre Dame team, he figured at end in the most successful exhibition of forward passing
                                                        the game had seen up to that time; and from that date on the forward pass grew steadily to its present importance in the game.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a coach he brought the shift play to its highest state of perfection and made it such an important factor in offensive football that the rules committee finally passed legislation designed to take some of its power away.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        That shift development, the back field hop, was the most important of his contributions to the coaching of the game, but he added others, notably the reshaping of the line. Prior to Rockne, linemen were big men inevitably. Rockne brought the idea of using
                                                        linemen, particularly guards, in interference, and demonstrated that the small, fast lineman could hold his own with the big man and outplay him where the big man was not as fast.
                                                    </p>

                                                        when no man failed to carry out his job the play often went for a touchdown.

                                                    <p>
                                                        This perfect play did a great deal to wipe away the idea of aiming first for scoring territory and then the score. Rockne always said that every play, if perfectly carried out, would go for a touchdown from wherever it was started. His last two teams
                                                        usually started their scoring with long runs from scrimmage.

                                                        In coaching he tried always for perfection and spent hours in teaching the art of blocking. Simple plays, well executed, were his idea of the way to win football games. He had small use for any so-called trick plays. There were only seven places in a
                                                        line to send a man with a ball, he said, and there ought not to be many more than seven plays.

                                                        Hard work was another of his slogans. &quot;The best thing I ever learned in life,&quot; he said last June during a visit to Poughkeepsie for the intercollegiate boat race there, &quot;was that things have to be worked for. A lot of people seem to think
                                                        there is some sort of magic in making a winning football team. There isn&apos;t, but there&apos;s plenty of work.&quot;

Suddenly Developed the Pass</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a player and captain of the 1913 Notre Dame team, the first to ever beat the Army, Rockne began his shaping of football&apos;s destinies by bringing the forward pass suddenly and dramatically into the front of the game. Army that season had scheduled
                                                        Notre Dame as a &quot;breather&quot; game on its schedule. Only a small crowd turned out, and they stood amazed as Notre Dame defeated Army, 35 to 13. Gus Dorais, now coach at Detroit, threw seventeen
                                                        passes in that game and thirteen were completed, and a great majority of these went to the short, chunky end, Knute Rockne.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The forward pass had been more or less of a haphazard thing until that time. The success of this Western team with it amazed the football world. Dorais and Rockne remained behind at West Point for a few days after that game to show the Army how it was
                                                        done. One of the results of that was the famous Pritchard to Merrillat combination of Army teams.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In that first success was an indication of the capacity for taking pains which Rockne owned. That game was the direct result of the Summer before. Dorais and Rockne had obtained vacation jobs together at a mid-West beach and included a football in their
                                                        baggage. All that Summer they got out on the beach and threw passes. The success against Army was no accident. It had been carefully planned.

Remarkable Record as Coach</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a coach, of course, Rockne&apos;s record is one of the most remarkable that any coach of any sport has ever piled up. Nearly all of his teams have been in the front rank of the game, despite the fact that they always played hard schedules. Five of
                                                        them were undefeated. Taking over the head coach job, after helping instruct in the chemistry department of Notre Dame, in 1918, Rockne had almost immediate success. His 1919 team was undefeated
                                                        and his 1920 team was one of the greatest that he had.

                                                    <p>
                                                        To the game in general Rockne brought the high development of the backfield shift and a new conception of line play. He never claimed the invention of the shift play. But there can be small argument with the idea that under him Notre Dame&apos;s players
                                                        brought it to its highest perfection.

                                                        So successful were his teams with the shift that three years ago the football rules committee, fearing the offense of the game would overbalance the defense, began ruling against it and this last year finally insisted that a full second, in which an official
                                                        might count five, must come between the close of the shift and the start of the ball.

                                                        Rockne never was reconciled to this and never lost an opportunity to defend his favorite style of play. Legislating against the shift, he said, was like taking the feinting out of boxing and leaving in only the slugging.

                                                        Rockne organized coaching schools in which coaches might gather during the off seasons and study the methods of others. He assisted with Summer schools all over the country and in 1928 even conducted one at sea when he chartered a ship and took a party
                                                        of coaches and athletes to the Olympic Games of that year.

                                                        Perhaps his greatest teams came in 1920, 1924, 1929 and 1930. On the first was George Gipp, who was named by Rockne as the greatest player he ever had. The coach told the story of seeing Gipp, who was not trying for the team, throwing a ball and kicking
                                                        on the campus and of inducing him to join the squad. Gipp died a few weeks after the close of the 1920 season of a throat infection, with Rockne at his bedside.

As a combination, they have not been excelled in modern back fields and they had a great line in front of them, led by the famous Adam
                                                        Walsh at centre, who is now assisting with the coaching at Yale. That team of the Four Horsemen won all over the country, beating Princeton at Princeton with a temperature of 10 above zero, and several
                                                        weeks later journeying to the Coast to defeat Stanford in a temperature of 70 degrees.

And the 1930 team came very near to being the best. Northwestern, Army
                                                        and Southern California were played on successive Saturdays. One Saturday, in Chicago, Army was turned back in ice and cold rain and the following week the highly regarded Southern California team
                                                        was badly beaten on the Coast.

There were, throughout the country, North, South, East and West, twenty-three head coaches of football from Notre Dame without
                                                        naming the assistants here and there. Notable among them are Walsh and Rip Miller, who has this year been elevated to head coach at Navy.

Dramatic in everything he did, even to his death, Rockne became a sort of god to the boys who played for
                                                        him. A great talker, a keen wit, he had a balanced, sane philosophy of life and a keen knowledge of psychology.

The year that Army and Navy played in Chicago, in 1926, he went to Chicago to watch the game, confident his strong

All week, Rockne coached without mentioning the defeat. The players kept waiting for him to say something. He did not. But when they boarded the train and opened

The players sat silently, waiting for him to say something. The minutes ticked off in the quiet room, and finally an official
                                                        came to tell them to come out. Rockne nodded, stood up and said, &quot;Come on, boys.&quot; That was all.

                                                    <p>From his days as a player Knute Rockne made his influence felt on the trend of football. As captain of the 1913 Notre Dame team, he figured at end in the most successful exhibition of forward passing
                                                        the game had seen up to that time; and from that date on the forward pass grew steadily to its present importance in the game.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a coach he brought the shift play to its highest state of perfection and made it such an important factor in offensive football that the rules committee finally passed legislation designed to take some of its power away.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        That shift development, the back field hop, was the most important of his contributions to the coaching of the game, but he added others, notably the reshaping of the line. Prior to Rockne, linemen were big men inevitably. Rockne brought the idea of using
                                                        linemen, particularly guards, in interference, and demonstrated that the small, fast lineman could hold his own with the big man and outplay him where the big man was not as fast.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p><b>
Changed Strategy of Touchdown</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He worked for the perfection of a team as a whole and his last two teams won game after game through the successful application of what came to be called &quot;the perfect plays.&quot; In these every individual carried out a part of the blocking, and
                                                        when no man failed to carry out his job the play often went for a touchdown.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This perfect play did a great deal to wipe away the idea of aiming first for scoring territory and then the score. Rockne always said that every play, if perfectly carried out, would go for a touchdown from wherever it was started. His last two teams
                                                        usually started their scoring with long runs from scrimmage.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In coaching he tried always for perfection and spent hours in teaching the art of blocking. Simple plays, well executed, were his idea of the way to win football games. He had small use for any so-called trick plays. There were only seven places in a
                                                        line to send a man with a ball, he said, and there ought not to be many more than seven plays.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Hard work was another of his slogans. &quot;The best thing I ever learned in life,&quot; he said last June during a visit to Poughkeepsie for the intercollegiate boat race there, &quot;was that things have to be worked for. A lot of people seem to think
                                                        there is some sort of magic in making a winning football team. There isn&apos;t, but there&apos;s plenty of work.&quot;
                                                    </p>

Suddenly Developed the Pass</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a player and captain of the 1913 Notre Dame team, the first to ever beat the Army, Rockne began his shaping of football&apos;s destinies by bringing the forward pass suddenly and dramatically into the front of the game. Army that season had scheduled
                                                        Notre Dame as a &quot;breather&quot; game on its schedule. Only a small crowd turned out, and they stood amazed as Notre Dame defeated Army, 35 to 13. Gus Dorais, now coach at Detroit, threw seventeen
                                                        passes in that game and thirteen were completed, and a great majority of these went to the short, chunky end, Knute Rockne.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The forward pass had been more or less of a haphazard thing until that time. The success of this Western team with it amazed the football world. Dorais and Rockne remained behind at West Point for a few days after that game to show the Army how it was
                                                        done. One of the results of that was the famous Pritchard to Merrillat combination of Army teams.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In that first success was an indication of the capacity for taking pains which Rockne owned. That game was the direct result of the Summer before. Dorais and Rockne had obtained vacation jobs together at a mid-West beach and included a football in their
                                                        baggage. All that Summer they got out on the beach and threw passes. The success against Army was no accident. It had been carefully planned.

Remarkable Record as Coach</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a coach, of course, Rockne&apos;s record is one of the most remarkable that any coach of any sport has ever piled up. Nearly all of his teams have been in the front rank of the game, despite the fact that they always played hard schedules. Five of
                                                        them were undefeated. Taking over the head coach job, after helping instruct in the chemistry department of Notre Dame, in 1918, Rockne had almost immediate success. His 1919 team was undefeated
                                                        and his 1920 team was one of the greatest that he had.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        To the game in general Rockne brought the high development of the backfield shift and a new conception of line play. He never claimed the invention of the shift play. But there can be small argument with the idea that under him Notre Dame&apos;s players
                                                        brought it to its highest perfection.

                                                    <p>
                                                        So successful were his teams with the shift that three years ago the football rules committee, fearing the offense of the game would overbalance the defense, began ruling against it and this last year finally insisted that a full second, in which an official
                                                        might count five, must come between the close of the shift and the start of the ball.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Rockne never was reconciled to this and never lost an opportunity to defend his favorite style of play. Legislating against the shift, he said, was like taking the feinting out of boxing and leaving in only the slugging.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Rockne organized coaching schools in which coaches might gather during the off seasons and study the methods of others. He assisted with Summer schools all over the country and in 1928 even conducted one at sea when he chartered a ship and took a party
                                                        of coaches and athletes to the Olympic Games of that year.

                                                        Perhaps his greatest teams came in 1920, 1924, 1929 and 1930. On the first was George Gipp, who was named by Rockne as the greatest player he ever had. The coach told the story of seeing Gipp, who was not trying for the team, throwing a ball and kicking
                                                        on the campus and of inducing him to join the squad. Gipp died a few weeks after the close of the 1920 season of a throat infection, with Rockne at his bedside.

                                                        The 1924 team was the one of the famous Four Horsemen, Harry Stuhldreher, Jimmy Crowley, Don Miller and Elmer Layden. As a combination, they have not been excelled in modern back fields and they had a great line in front of them, led by the famous Adam
                                                        Walsh at centre, who is now assisting with the coaching at Yale. That team of the Four Horsemen won all over the country, beating Princeton at Princeton with a temperature of 10 above zero, and several
                                                        weeks later journeying to the Coast to defeat Stanford in a temperature of 70 degrees.

And the 1930 team came very near to being the best. Northwestern, Army
                                                        and Southern California were played on successive Saturdays. One Saturday, in Chicago, Army was turned back in ice and cold rain and the following week the highly regarded Southern California team
                                                        was badly beaten on the Coast.

There were, throughout the country, North, South, East and West, twenty-three head coaches of football from Notre Dame without
                                                        naming the assistants here and there. Notable among them are Walsh and Rip Miller, who has this year been elevated to head coach at Navy.

Dramatic in everything he did, even to his death, Rockne became a sort of god to the boys who played for
                                                        him. A great talker, a keen wit, he had a balanced, sane philosophy of life and a keen knowledge of psychology.

The year that Army and Navy played in Chicago, in 1926, he went to Chicago to watch the game, confident his strong
                                                        team would beat Carnegie Tech without too much trouble in his absence. They did not.

All week, Rockne coached without mentioning the defeat. The players kept waiting for him to say something. He did not. But when they boarded the train and opened

The players sat silently, waiting for him to say something. The minutes ticked off in the quiet room, and finally an official
                                                        came to tell them to come out. Rockne nodded, stood up and said, &quot;Come on, boys.&quot; That was all.

                                                        A polished story-teller and a constantly interesting companion, Rockne made friends wherever he went, and was almost as much at home at the colleges he played against on his numerous visits as he was at his own. At these places he will be greatly missed
                                                        as a friend.
