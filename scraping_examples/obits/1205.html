He was 65
                                                        years old.

He had undergone surgery at the hospital a month ago for the removal of a lung tumor that was discovered after he entered the hospital for treatment of an old neck injury received
                                                        in a polo match. On Nov. 30 he re-entered the hospital for a &quot;post-operative checkup.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Disney was the last of Hollywood&apos;s veteran moviemakers who remained in personal control of a major studio.

His nature films were almost as popular as his cartoons, and eventually he expanded into
                                                        feature-length movies using only live actors.

Mr. Disney acquired a 420-acre ranch that was used for shooting exterior shots for his movies and television
                                                        productions. Among the lucrative by- products of his output were many comic scripts and enormous royalties paid to him by toy-makers who used his characters.

Its international fame was emphasized in 1959 by the then Soviet Premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, who protested, when visiting Hollywood, that he had

For Mickey Mouse, the foundation of his realm, Mr. Disney had to pawn and sell almost everything because most exhibitors looked upon it as just another cartoon. But
                                                        when the public had a chance to speak, the noble-hearted mouse with the high-pitched voice, red pants, yellow shoes and white gloves became the most beloved of Hollywood stars.

It became one of the biggest money-makers in movie

                                                        He was, however, the only major movie producer who refused to release his movies to television. He contended, with a good deal of profitable evidence, that each seven years there would be another generation that would flock to the movie theaters to see
                                                        his old films.

In France he was known as Michel Souris; in Italy, Topolino; in Japan, Miki Kuchi; in Spain, Miguel Ratoncito; in Latin America, El Raton Miguelito; in Sweden, Muse Pigg, and in Russia, Mikki Maus.
                                                        On D-Day during World War II Mickey Mouse was the pass-word of Allied Supreme Headquarters in Europe.

He dug into books for Dumbo, Bambi, Peter Pan, The Three Little Pigs, Ferdinand the Bull, Cinderella, the Sleeping Beauty, Brer Rabbit, Pinocchio. In &quot;Fantasia,&quot;
                                                        he blended cartoon stories with classical music.

Most popular were big-eared Mickey of the piping voice; choleric Donald Duck of the unintelligible quacking; Pluto,

His brown eyes became alternately intense and dreamy. He fingered an ashtray as he gazed around an office
                                                        so cluttered with trophies that it looked like a pawn shop.

He was honored by Yale the same day as it honored Thomas Mann, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist. Prof. William Lyon Phelps of Yale
                                                        said of Mr. Disney:

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;He has accomplished something that has defied all the efforts and experiments of the laboratories in zoology and biology. He has given animals souls.&quot;

                                                        By the end of his career, the list of 700 awards and honors that Mr. Disney received from many nations filled 29 typewritten pages, and included 29 Oscars, four Emmys and the Presidential Freedom Medal.
                                                    </p>

                                                        There were tributes of a different nature. Toys in the shape of Disney characters sold by the many millions. Paris couturiers and expensive jewelers both used Disney patterns. One of the most astounding exhibitions of popular devotion came in the wake
                                                        of Mr. Disney&apos;s films about Davy Crockett. In a matter of months, youngsters all over the country who would balk at wearing a hat in winter, were adorned in &apos;coonskin caps in midsummer.

                                                        In some ways Mr. Disney resembled the movie pioneers of a generation before him. He was not afraid of risk. One day, when all the world thought of him as a fabulous success, he told an acquaintance, &quot;I&apos;m in great shape, I now owe the bank only
                                                        eight million.&quot;

                                                        A friend of 20 years recalled that he once said, &quot;A buck is something to be spent creating.&quot; Early in 1960 he declared, &quot;It&apos;s not what you have, but how much you can borrow that&apos;s important in business.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Disney had no trouble borrowing money in his later years. Bankers, in fact, sought him out. Last year Walt Disney Productions grossed $110-million. His family owns 38 per cent of this publicly held corporation, and all of Retlaw, a company that controls
                                                        the use of Mr. Disney&apos;s name.

                                                        Mr. Disney&apos;s contract with Walt Disney Productions gave him a basic salary of $182,000 a year and a deferred salary of $2,500 a week, with options to buy up to 25 per cent interest in each of his live- action features. It is understood that he began
                                                        exercising these options in 1961, but only up to 10 per cent. These interests alone would have made him a multimillionaire.

An associate of many years said the boss &quot;could make you feel one-inch tall, but he wouldn&apos;t let anybody else do it. That was
                                                        his privilege.&quot;

Did Not Draw Mickey Mouse

                                                        This attitude by Mr. Disney was one of the reasons some artists disparaged him. Another was that he did none of the drawings of his most famous cartoons. Mickey Mouse, for instance, was drawn by Ubbe Iwerks, who was with Mr. Disney almost from the beginning.

                                                        However, Mr. Iwerks insisted that Disney could have done the drawings, but was too busy. Mr. Disney did, however, furnish Mickey&apos;s voice for all cartoons. He also sat in on all story conferences.

Except when imbued with some new Disneyland project or movie idea, he was inclined to be phlegmatic. His
                                                        nasal speech, delivered slowly, was rarely accompanied by gestures. His phlegmatic manner often masked his independence and tenacity.

So he went to France as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross. He decorated the sides of his ambulance with cartoons and had his work published
                                                        in Stars and Stripes.

He would say to friends, &quot;This is the most marvelous thing that has ever happened.&quot;

Mr. Disney went to New York to try to keep
                                                        the series but failed. When he returned, he, his wife, his brother Roy and Mr. Iwerks tried to think of a character for a new series, but failed. They decided on a mouse. Mrs. Disney named it Mickey.

He made a second Mickey Mouse, this one with sound, called &quot;Steambot Bill.&quot; In October, 1928, the cartoon opened at the Colony Theater in New York. Success
                                                        was immediate and the Disney empire began.
