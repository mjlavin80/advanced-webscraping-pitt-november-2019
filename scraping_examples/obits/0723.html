                                                    <h5>By ALDEN WHITMAN</h5>
                                                    <p>Haile Selassie, the last emperor in the 3,000-year-old Ethiopian monarchy, who ruled for half a century before he was deposed by military coup last September, died yesterday in a small apartment in his
                                                        former palace. He was 83 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>His death was played down by the military rulers who succeeded him in Addis Ababa, who announced it in a normally scheduled radio newscast there at 7 A.M. They said that he had been found dead in his
                                                        bed by a servant, and that the cause of death was probably related to the effects of a prostate operation Haile Selassie underwent two months ago.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The broadcast said that the once-revered &quot;Lion of Judah&apos;s&quot; only surviving daughter, Princess Tenagne-Work, visited the former Emperor Tuesday at his request, after he had determined that his health was rapidly deteriorating.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But in London, Crown Prince Afsa Wossen Haile Selassie, who has been living abroad since the leftist government in Ethiopia formally declared an end to the monarchy last March, said his father had been in &quot;excellent health.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>Seized in a military coup after almost a year of festering discontent with his regime, Haile Selassie, who was accustomed to Rolls-Royces, was hustled from his spacious palace to an army officer&apos;s

                                                        and insulted the officers as insolent, and they, with mounting ire, decided on the spot to take him to a military camp rather than to another palace. And on the way, he was jeered by crowds yelling:
                                                        &quot;Thief! Thief!&quot;

                                                        provinces. The unrest was compounded in February, 1974, when mutinies broke out in the military over low pay; and a secessionist guerrilla war in Eritrea complicated the Emperor&apos;s problems.
                                                        In the spring and summer, after riots in Addis Ababa, the capital, his absolute power was gradually circumscribed.

The reform process, moreover, created a dependency
                                                        on the United States, which equipped the army and which drew Ethiopia into the periphery of superpower politics.

He started to inch away, but the Emperor summoned him back and tossed him a bundle of banknotes anyway.

                                                    <p>Unbending on protocol and punctilio, the Emperor, in his public appearances, recalled the splendor and opulence of Suleiman the Magnificent or Louis XIV, with the difference that he lived and worked
                                                        in a modern atmosphere and journeyed abroad in a commandeered Ethiopian Airlines plane. He once had three palaces; but after he transformed the Gueneteleul Palace into the Haile Selassie I University
                                                        in 1960, he was reduced to a palace to live in--the Jubilee--and one to work in--the Ghibi.</p>

                                                        of reverence for his person. He took seriously the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and he never allowed his subjects to forget that he considered himself the Elect of God. Indeed, he combined
                                                        in his person the temporal sovereignty of the state and the leadership of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, the country&apos;s established church.

                                                        the world. His talk, though light, was not likely to be gay or mirth-providing or quotable. He referred to himself always with the imperial &quot;we.&quot;</p>

                                                        and some great-grandchildren, with whom he liked to surround himself at dinner.

                                                        services. The bulk of the people lived in mud and straw huts, even in Addis Ababa.

When Ras Makonnen died in 1906, his son, who already had a rudimentary education and spoke French, was summoned to the Court at Addis

                                                        was held were not so confining, however, as to prevent him from enjoying the variety of women with whom Tafari plied him.

                                                        an end to the chaos that threatened to envelop Ethiopia and turned his country&apos;s eyes ever so slightly toward the outside world.</p>
                                                    <p>In 1923 Tafari had the kingdom accepted as a member of the League of Nations. He acted in the hope that league membership would exempt Ethiopia from the colonial ambitions of other countries.

                                                        limits on the royal prerogative were negligible, it was a step away from feudalism.

                                                        promulgated, if not enforced. Virtually total abolition was not accomplished until 1964.</p>

His pretense, that of bringing civilization to a backward country, concealed Italian imperial ambitions for an African colony to supplement Italian Somaliland
                                                        and Eritrea. In the diplomatic footwork that followed the border clash, the Emperor referred the dispute to the League of Nations for mediation; but Britain and France gave Mussolini to understand
                                                        that he could expect a free hand in Ethiopia.

Haile Selassie, meantime, went to live as an unwanted guest in Bath, England; he was so broke that

                                                    <p>From this seedy oblivion the Emperor was rescued on May 10, 1940, when Italy entered World War II as an enemy of Britain. Churchill, long a friend, had him flown incognito, as Mr. Strong, to Africa.
                                                        Landing at Alexandria, he spent the night in the men&apos;s room of the Italian Yacht Club before going on to Khartoum in the Sudan. There he helped to organize an army of liberation with the aid
                                                        of Orde Wingate, one of the most picturesque British officers in the war.</p>
                                                    <p>The result of these exertions was that Haile Selassie returned to his country on Jan. 20, 1941, and made his state entry into Addis Ababa on May 5 in the back of an Alfa Romeo motor car. It was five
                                                        years to the day since the Italians had entered the city. The country remained under British administration, however, until Jan. 31, 1942, when London recognized Ethiopia as a sovereign state.

                                                    <p>In the years that followed the restoration, Haile Selassie enhanced his personal power while acting slowly to solve the country&apos;s grave economic and social problems. Some advance in education was
                                                        also made, for 200 school buildings were put up between 1942 and 1952. In this period, too, a new force was reaching manhood in the kingdom--the educated elite whose travels and schooling abroad
                                                        made them restive over their nation&apos;s introversions.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Partly as the result of pressure from this group and partly because of the rising tide of anticolonialism in Africa, Haile Selassie granted a new constitution in 1955. It promised his subjects equal
                                                        rights under the law, plus a vote; but it also retained his traditional prerogatives. One clause read:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;By virtue of His Imperial Blood as well as by the anointing which He has received, the person of the Emperor is sacred. His dignity is inviolable and His Power indisputable. He is, consequently, entitled to all the honors due Him in accordance with
                                                        tradition and the present Constitution. Anyone so bold as to seek to injure the Emperor will be punished.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Mutiny During Absence</b>
                                                    <p>The surface placidity of Ethiopia was shattered in 1960, when Haile Selassie was absent on a state trip to Brazil. The Imperial Bodyguard mutinied and some members of the royal family, including Crown
                                                        Prince Asfa Wossen, joined an attempt to dethrone the Emperor and promote faster social and economic progress. The Emperor returnedto Addis Ababa, crushed the revolt and had the commander of the
                                                        bodyguard publicly hanged for treason. The Crown Prince was put out of favor, from which he finally emerged, but slowly.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The attempted coup led the Emperor to try to communicate more directly with his subjects in radio talks and to indicated what he was doing for them in his paternal fashion.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>One such advance was foreign aid. In the final years of his reign he contrived to obtain help from diverse sources without creating crosscurrents among the donors. Italy and Yugoslavia build dams for
                                                        him; the Addis Ababa airport was constructed by the United States; the Soviet Union put up a polytechnic institute on the shores of Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The Emperor much enjoyed state visits--to Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, to Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, to the United States, where he was the guest of the last five Presidents before Gerald R. Ford.
                                                        In all, he traveled to more than 60 countries, including China, where he was received in 1971 by Mao Tse-tung.</p>
