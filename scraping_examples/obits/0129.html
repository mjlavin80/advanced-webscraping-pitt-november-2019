His first education was received in the public schools of Niles, but when he was nine years of age his parents removed to Poland, Mahoning County, Ohio, a town which was at that time well known for
                                                        its educational facilities.

Excelling in most of his studies, he was especially noted for his brilliancy in debate. He evinced a lively interest in all the great public questions of the day,
                                                        and his speeches upon them were worthy of a much more matured mind. His application was intense, and soon his health was so undermined that he was obliged to return home for rest and recuperation,
                                                        but even then he did not escape a severe illness. When his health was restored he did not return to school, but sought and obtained a place as a teacher in the public schools of the Kerr district,

A war meeting was held in the Sparrow tavern. At the close of a patriotic speech by an eloquent speaker a call was made for volunteers. Young
                                                        McKinley was among those who stepped forward. He went with the recruits to Columbus and was there enlisted as a private in Company E of the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry. This regiment numbered
                                                        among its field and staff officers William S. Rosecrans, after Major General, and Rutherford B. Hayes, nineteenth President of the United States.

McKinley was in charge of the commissary department of his brigade, and, necessarily, his post of duty was with the supplies, about two miles from where his famished comrades
                                                        were battling with the enemy. Enlisting stragglers to help him, Sergt. McKinley filled two wagons with cans containing hot coffee and other supplies, and hurried them to the front. The mules of one
                                                        wagon became disabled under the terrific fire, but the plucky young officer, undaunted, continued his efforts, and finally reached his regiment with the supplies, being received with tremendous cheers.

The Governor was so impressed with it that he at once requested that a Lieutenant&apos;s commission be made out for McKinley. This was done, the commission
                                                        dating from Sept. 24, 1862. Gen. Hayes in describing this incident in a speech at the Lakeside, Chautauqua, in 1891, said:

McKinley&apos;s hand every man in the regiment was served with hot coffee and warm meats, a thing which had never occurred under similar circumstances in any other army in the world. He passed under fire and delivered with his own hands

On Feb. 7, 1863, he received his commission as First Lieutenant. It was under his leadership that his company
                                                        was the first to scramble over the fortifications at Camp Platt and silence the enemy&apos;s guns. It was at the battle of Kernstown, near Winchester, that he gained his greatest military distinction.

He was on the extreme right, and was soon attacked with such fury that he was obliged to fall back toward Winchester.
                                                        The movement was successfully executed, except that the Thirteenth West Virginia Regiment failed to retire, and was in imminent danger of capture. Lieut. McKinley was ordered to go and bring the
                                                        regiment away, if it had not already fallen into the hands of the enemy. It was a mission fraught with the gravest peril. As he urged his horse through the open fields, over fences and across ditches,

But when the smoke had cleared away they saw him sitting erect in his saddle
                                                        and pressing on. He delivered his orders, and the regiment was rescued after a desperate conflict with overwhelmingly superior forces.

He loved McKinley as a father, and when he sent him on his perilous mission he truly believed, as he said to the Lieutenant
                                                        on greeting him, and as he afterward said in many public addresses, that he would never see him alive again. That very same night Lieut. McKinley led a party of volunteers to rescue four guns and
                                                        some caissons, which were in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. It was a most dangerous piece of work, gallantly accomplished. The next day, July 25, 1864 at the age of twenty-one,
                                                        McKinley was promoted to be a Captain.

At Opequan and Fisher&apos;s Hill he again distinguished himself. Soon after the battle of Fisher&apos;s Hill his regiment was detailed as a train guard
                                                        to Martinsburg. On the march the men voted. Capt. McKinley&apos;s first ballot was cast for Lincoln, whose career his own was to parallel so closely, even to assassination.

Later he was assigned as Acting Assistant Adjutant General on the staff of Gen. Samuel S. Carroll, commanding the veteran reserve corps at Washington,
                                                        where he remained through that exciting period which included the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appamattox and the assassination of President Lincoln. It was just a month before Mr. Lincoln fell a

At the close of the war, although a military career was open to him, he decided to leave the army. On his return to Poland a complimentary dinner was
                                                        tendered to him by the citizens, who took a pride in his military achievements. He at once began the stud of the law, entering the office of Judge Charles E. Glidden, at Youngstown, Ohio. After one
                                                        year&apos;s study under the preceptorship of Judge Glidden, he went to law school in Albany, N.Y., and in March, 1867, was admitted to the bar at Warren, Ohio.

He always manifested a keen interest in politics, and in the same year that he located in Canton his first political speeches were made. He was elected Prosecuting

Miss Saxton&apos;s grandparents were among the founders of Canton nearly a century ago. Her father was one of the prominent bankers of the city. Her father&apos;s means enabled her to have

Since their death Mrs. McKinley has been an invalid. Her dependence upon her husband has been a matter of tender pathos to all who know them,
                                                        and his tenderness and devotion to her has greatly added to the admiration of the American people for him.

                                                        It was in 1876 that Mr. McKinley was first nominated for Congress. He was elected by 3,300 majority. During the progress of this canvass he visited the Cy over Gov. Campbell, the Democractic candidate for re-election, was decisive, and he polled the largest
                                                        vote so far cast for Governor in the history of Ohio. Campbell had been elected in 1889 by 11,000 plurality; McKinley defeated him by 21,500.

                                                        Soon after his election as Governor the Presidential campaign began. Gov. McKinley was elected a delegate at large to the convention. When the delegates gathered at Minneapolis the contest was apparently between Harrison and Blaine. McKinley came out
                                                        for Harrison. The opponents of the President, when they found Blaine&apos;s chances were not all they had hoped, started a boom for McKinley, whose position was then one unexampled in the history
                                                        of politics in this country.

It was a most trying situation, but he bore himself with coolness and decision. When Ohio recorded two votes for him he challenged the vote so
                                                        as to put himself on record for Harrison. When the roll call was complete, Harrison received 535 votes, Blaine 182, McKinley 182, and Reed 4. Leaving the chair, Mr. McKinley mounted a seat in the
                                                        Ohio delegation and moved to make the nomination of Harrison unanimous.

He made 325 speeches in 300 different towns. For over eight weeks he averaged more than seven speeches a day. He traveled over 16,000 miles and addressed
                                                        more than 2,000,000 people.

Then the campaign for the Presidency was begun, and all over the country Republican enthusiasm sprung up for McKinley. It was soon
                                                        evident that the honor which twice before might have been his but for his high sense of loyalty, was now to be thrust upon him. In the Republican National convention, held in St. Louis in 1896, he
                                                        was nominated on the first ballot; and in the ensuing election he received a popular vote of 7,104,770, a plurality of 601,854 over his principal opponent, William Jennings Bryan. In the Electoral
                                                        College he received 271 votes against 176 for Bryan.

                                                        Upon both of the important developments he took his positions by a process of growth. In June, 1897, he was subject to Democratic criticism for the slowness of his action regarding Cuba. In December came his proclamation, through Secretary Sherman, regarding
                                                        the distress and destitution prevailing under the Spanish administration, with the appeal for charitable relief. This was done only after consultation with the Spanish Minister Dupuy de Lome. It
                                                        was not until after the Maine was sunk that a hostile tone marked his official utterance. On March 28 he transmitted to Congress the report of the court of inquiry, concluding: &quot;I do not permit
                                                        myself to doubt that the sense of justice of the Spanish Nation will dictate a course of action suggested by honor and the friendly relations of the two Governments.&quot;

                                                        On April 7 he received the joint representations of the diplomats of Europe, appealing to the &quot;humanity and moderation&quot; of the United States in its dealings with Spain. If England had not participated in the representation harm might have been
                                                        done, but the participation of England robbed the innovation of all hostile significance, and a most tactful reply was made. He &quot;appreciated the disinterested character&quot; of the communication
                                                        and relied upon a similar appreciation of the motives of the United States. On April 11 followed his message to Congress advising armed intervention, after a description of Weyler&apos;s policy of
                                                        extermination, for the reasons of general humanity, protection for American citizens, and property, and the general National welfare. Congress promptly responded, giving the authority requested.
                                                        By a unanimous vote $50,000,000 was placed in his sole control for purposes of National defense. This was done quite casually. Sundry appropriations were made for printing and binding in amounts
                                                        of five figures, then followed three lines providing for the beginning of the war from funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.

                                                        Events marched rapidly. On April 22 the blockade of Cuba was proclaimed by him, and on June 27 he sent his message, advising the reward of Hobson and his almost forgotten companions, Newcomb, Powell, and Hodgson, for their bravery at Santiago. The first
                                                        week of the following January came his message communicating the Treaty of Paris and peace. His hastily sketched official connection with the Cuban war may be said to end with his order for the burial
                                                        of the soldier dead on April 4.

                                                        Only July 24, 1897, President McKinley sent to Congress a message recommending the appointment of a non-partisan Monetary Commission. He repeated the words of his inaugural, and in due course followed the appointment of the resultless Wolcott commission.
                                                        He was far from escaping reproach for his sincerity and consistency, but looking backward in perspective it seems as though his influence upon those more heretical and weak-hearted than himself was
                                                        quite as great as though he had been so far in advance of them as to have lost his influence through lack of touch with those whose support was essential to action. He recurred to the subject with
                                                        renewed vigor in his message to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress, making it the leading topic, and the bill which became law was introduced in the House on Dec. 4, 1890. The Senate proposed
                                                        a substitute, and there was a legislative wrangle, which is no part of his personal record. He cast his unofficial as well as his official influence into the scale, as, for example, by his interviews
                                                        with Senator Chandler and H. H. Hanna, who gave publicity to his words in an influential manner.

                                                        at Boston, Ocean Grove, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Here, also, as in financial questions, he felt his taking no step unnecessarily, and each in logical succession to its predecessor.

McKinleyism and a high tariff are familiar synonyms. He was said to have worn a suit of American

                                                        in the spelling of their names, how the &quot;a&quot; in the name of his ancestors became an &quot;e&quot; in his.

A gallant soldier himself, his disposition has always been toward peace.
                                                        He was the last man to hold out against the war with Spain, yet, when it was forced against him, he quickly demonstrated, as Senator Foraker once remarked in a public speech, that &quot;he understood

His first education was received in the public schools of Niles, but when he was nine years of age his parents removed to Poland, Mahoning County, Ohio, a town which was at that time well known for
                                                        its educational facilities.

Excelling in most of his studies, he was especially noted for his brilliancy in debate. He evinced a lively interest in all the great public questions of the day,
                                                        and his speeches upon them were worthy of a much more matured mind. His application was intense, and soon his health was so undermined that he was obliged to return home for rest and recuperation,
                                                        but even then he did not escape a severe illness. When his health was restored he did not return to school, but sought and obtained a place as a teacher in the public schools of the Kerr district,
                                                        near Poland.

A war meeting was held in the Sparrow tavern. At the close of a patriotic speech by an eloquent speaker a call was made for volunteers. Young
                                                        McKinley was among those who stepped forward. He went with the recruits to Columbus and was there enlisted as a private in Company E of the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry. This regiment numbered
                                                        among its field and staff officers William S. Rosecrans, after Major General, and Rutherford B. Hayes, nineteenth President of the United States.

McKinley was in charge of the commissary department of his brigade, and, necessarily, his post of duty was with the supplies, about two miles from where his famished comrades
                                                        were battling with the enemy. Enlisting stragglers to help him, Sergt. McKinley filled two wagons with cans containing hot coffee and other supplies, and hurried them to the front. The mules of one
                                                        wagon became disabled under the terrific fire, but the plucky young officer, undaunted, continued his efforts, and finally reached his regiment with the supplies, being received with tremendous cheers.

The Governor was so impressed with it that he at once requested that a Lieutenant&apos;s commission be made out for McKinley. This was done, the commission
                                                        dating from Sept. 24, 1862. Gen. Hayes in describing this incident in a speech at the Lakeside, Chautauqua, in 1891, said:

McKinley&apos;s hand every man in the regiment was served with hot coffee and warm meats, a thing which had never occurred under similar circumstances in any other army in the world. He passed under fire and delivered with his own hands

On Feb. 7, 1863, he received his commission as First Lieutenant. It was under his leadership that his company
                                                        was the first to scramble over the fortifications at Camp Platt and silence the enemy&apos;s guns. It was at the battle of Kernstown, near Winchester, that he gained his greatest military distinction.

He was on the extreme right, and was soon attacked with such fury that he was obliged to fall back toward Winchester.
                                                        The movement was successfully executed, except that the Thirteenth West Virginia Regiment failed to retire, and was in imminent danger of capture. Lieut. McKinley was ordered to go and bring the
                                                        regiment away, if it had not already fallen into the hands of the enemy. It was a mission fraught with the gravest peril. As he urged his horse through the open fields, over fences and across ditches,
                                                        the fire of the enemy was poured out upon him.

But when the smoke had cleared away they saw him sitting erect in his saddle
                                                        and pressing on. He delivered his orders, and the regiment was rescued after a desperate conflict with overwhelmingly superior forces.

                                                        As McKinley came back with the regiment he was cheered by the whole brigade. Col. Hayes was filled with emotion on seeing him. He loved McKinley as a father, and when he sent him on his perilous mission he truly believed, as he said to the Lieutenant
                                                        on greeting him, and as he afterward said in many public addresses, that he would never see him alive again. That very same night Lieut. McKinley led a party of volunteers to rescue four guns and
                                                        some caissons, which were in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. It was a most dangerous piece of work, gallantly accomplished. The next day, July 25, 1864 at the age of twenty-one,
                                                        McKinley was promoted to be a Captain.

At Opequan and Fisher&apos;s Hill he again distinguished himself. Soon after the battle of Fisher&apos;s Hill his regiment was detailed as a train guard
                                                        to Martinsburg. On the march the men voted. Capt. McKinley&apos;s first ballot was cast for Lincoln, whose career his own was to parallel so closely, even to assassination.

Later he was assigned as Acting Assistant Adjutant General on the staff of Gen. Samuel S. Carroll, commanding the veteran reserve corps at Washington,

At the close of the war, although a military career was open to him, he decided to leave the army. On his return to Poland a complimentary dinner was
                                                        tendered to him by the citizens, who took a pride in his military achievements. He at once began the stud of the law, entering the office of Judge Charles E. Glidden, at Youngstown, Ohio. After one
                                                        year&apos;s study under the preceptorship of Judge Glidden, he went to law school in Albany, N.Y., and in March, 1867, was admitted to the bar at Warren, Ohio.

He always manifested a keen interest in politics, and in the same year that he located in Canton his first political speeches were made. He was elected Prosecuting

Miss Saxton&apos;s grandparents were among the founders of Canton nearly a century ago. Her father was one of the prominent bankers of the city. Her father&apos;s means enabled her to have

                                                        training. Accordingly he took her into the bank as cashier, a position which she filled for some years with ability. It was while she was cashier in her father&apos;s bank that William McKinley made
                                                        her acquaintance. Her beauty and her position in society naturally attracted many admirers, but her preference for the rising young lawyer was soon marked.

During their courtship he always accompanied her to her church before going to his own. Miss Saxton&apos;s parents made no objection

Since their death Mrs. McKinley has been an invalid. Her dependence upon her husband has been a matter of tender pathos to all who know them,

During the progress of this canvass he visited the Cy over Gov. Campbell, the Democractic candidate for re-election, was decisive, and he polled the largest
                                                        vote so far cast for Governor in the history of Ohio. Campbell had been elected in 1889 by 11,000 plurality; McKinley defeated him by 21,500.

                                                        Soon after his election as Governor the Presidential campaign began. Gov. McKinley was elected a delegate at large to the convention. When the delegates gathered at Minneapolis the contest was apparently between Harrison and Blaine. McKinley came out
                                                        for Harrison. The opponents of the President, when they found Blaine&apos;s chances were not all they had hoped, started a boom for McKinley, whose position was then one unexampled in the history
                                                        of politics in this country.

It was a most trying situation, but he bore himself with coolness and decision. When Ohio recorded two votes for him he challenged the vote so
                                                        as to put himself on record for Harrison. When the roll call was complete, Harrison received 535 votes, Blaine 182, McKinley 182, and Reed 4. Leaving the chair, Mr. McKinley mounted a seat in the
                                                        Ohio delegation and moved to make the nomination of Harrison unanimous.

He made 325 speeches in 300 different towns. For over eight weeks he averaged more than seven speeches a day. He traveled over 16,000 miles and addressed
                                                        more than 2,000,000 people.

Then the campaign for the Presidency was begun, and all over the country Republican enthusiasm sprung up for McKinley. It was soon
                                                        evident that the honor which twice before might have been his but for his high sense of loyalty, was now to be thrust upon him. In the Republican National convention, held in St. Louis in 1896, he
                                                        was nominated on the first ballot; and in the ensuing election he received a popular vote of 7,104,770, a plurality of 601,854 over his principal opponent, William Jennings Bryan. In the Electoral
                                                        College he received 271 votes against 176 for Bryan.

                                                        Upon both of the important developments he took his positions by a process of growth. In June, 1897, he was subject to Democratic criticism for the slowness of his action regarding Cuba. In December came his proclamation, through Secretary Sherman, regarding
                                                        the distress and destitution prevailing under the Spanish administration, with the appeal for charitable relief. This was done only after consultation with the Spanish Minister Dupuy de Lome. It
                                                        was not until after the Maine was sunk that a hostile tone marked his official utterance. On March 28 he transmitted to Congress the report of the court of inquiry, concluding: &quot;I do not permit
                                                        myself to doubt that the sense of justice of the Spanish Nation will dictate a course of action suggested by honor and the friendly relations of the two Governments.&quot;

                                                        On April 7 he received the joint representations of the diplomats of Europe, appealing to the &quot;humanity and moderation&quot; of the United States in its dealings with Spain. If England had not participated in the representation harm might have been
                                                        done, but the participation of England robbed the innovation of all hostile significance, and a most tactful reply was made. He &quot;appreciated the disinterested character&quot; of the communication
                                                        and relied upon a similar appreciation of the motives of the United States. On April 11 followed his message to Congress advising armed intervention, after a description of Weyler&apos;s policy of
                                                        extermination, for the reasons of general humanity, protection for American citizens, and property, and the general National welfare. Congress promptly responded, giving the authority requested.
                                                        By a unanimous vote $50,000,000 was placed in his sole control for purposes of National defense. This was done quite casually. Sundry appropriations were made for printing and binding in amounts
                                                        of five figures, then followed three lines providing for the beginning of the war from funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.

                                                        Events marched rapidly. On April 22 the blockade of Cuba was proclaimed by him, and on June 27 he sent his message, advising the reward of Hobson and his almost forgotten companions, Newcomb, Powell, and Hodgson, for their bravery at Santiago. The first
                                                        week of the following January came his message communicating the Treaty of Paris and peace. His hastily sketched official connection with the Cuban war may be said to end with his order for the burial
                                                        of the soldier dead on April 4.

He repeated the words of his inaugural, and in due course followed the appointment of the resultless Wolcott commission.
                                                        He was far from escaping reproach for his sincerity and consistency, but looking backward in perspective it seems as though his influence upon those more heretical and weak-hearted than himself was
                                                        quite as great as though he had been so far in advance of them as to have lost his influence through lack of touch with those whose support was essential to action. He recurred to the subject with
                                                        renewed vigor in his message to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress, making it the leading topic, and the bill which became law was introduced in the House on Dec. 4, 1890. The Senate proposed
                                                        a substitute, and there was a legislative wrangle, which is no part of his personal record. He cast his unofficial as well as his official influence into the scale, as, for example, by his interviews
                                                        with Senator Chandler and H. H. Hanna, who gave publicity to his words in an influential manner.

McKinleyism and a high tariff are familiar synonyms. He was said to have worn a suit of American
