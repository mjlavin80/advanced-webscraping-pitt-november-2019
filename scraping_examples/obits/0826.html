                                                    <h5>By HAROLD M. SCHMECK Jr.</h5>
                                                    <p>Dr. Albert B. Sabin, the pioneering researcher on viruses and viral diseases who developed the vaccine that is the main defense against polio in the United States and much of the rest of the world, died
                                                        yesterday at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. He was 86 years old and lived in Washington.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The cause of death was congestive heart failure, the hospital said. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He was best known for developing the live-virus polio vaccine, taken orally. It became generally preferred over the alternative killed-virus vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk after a sometimes intense clash between the rival camps and their principals.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although the Salk polio vaccine, which is injected, proved to be effective in sharply reducing the number of poliomyelitis cases in the United States, after it went on the market in 1955, Dr. Sabin persisted in his efforts to develop a vaccine based on
                                                        a living virus, which he believed would be superior.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. Sabin&apos;s vaccine, which contained harmless, or attenuated, polio viruses, was developed by him and his co-workers at the University of Cincinnati. Before coming into wide use in this country, the vaccine was tested in millions of people in 1958
                                                        and 1959 in the Soviet Union, where it proved widely successful. In the United States the vaccine was tested earlier on prisoners who volunteered for the experiments and before that on Dr. Sabin
                                                        himself and members of his family.

Dr. Sabin, however, never admitted that his vaccine was responsible.

                                                        caused the disastrous pandemic of 1918-1919.

He argued that the vaccination campaign should await evidence that the virus was indeed reappearing in the

Through research on monkeys he developed a method for determining how the polio

He and his family immigrated to the United States in 1921, at least partly to escape the persecution of Jews. He attended high school in Paterson, N.J., after

                                                    <p>But Dr. Salk issued a statement yesterday praising Dr. Sabin&apos;s enduring contributions to the control of polio.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In 1970 Dr. Sabin became president of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel but stepped down in November 1972 because of a heart condition for which he had open heart surgery.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In the latter part of his career, Dr. Sabin&apos;s interest in viruses led him into research on the relationships between human cancer and viruses. Although he thought at one time that he and co-workers
                                                        had discovered a virus that caused several types of human cancer, he later concluded that the virus in question was not a factor in human malignant disease. </p>
                                                    <p>Dr. Sabin was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1951 and received numerous other honors, including the Bruce Memorial Award of the American College of Physicians in 1961, the Feltinelli
                                                        Prize of the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome in 1964, the Lasker Clinical Science Award in 1965 and the United States National Medal of Science in 1971.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Throughout his long career he was noted for diligence, hard work and long hours as well as brilliance in research.

                                                        &quot;A scientist who is also a human being cannot rest while knowledge which might be used to reduce suffering rests on the shelf,&quot; he once said.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. Sabin was married to Sylvia Tregillus in 1935; she died in 1966. He married Jane Warner, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1972, he married Heloisa Dunshee de Abranches.
                                                    </p>

                                                        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Deborah Sabin of Yakima, Wash., and Amy Horn of Palo Alto, Calif., and three grandchildren.
