His Career as &quot;Glorifier&quot;</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Ziegfeld, known as the &quot;glorifier of the American girl,&quot; began his career in professional theatrics with the profitable exploitation of the strong man, Eugene Sandow, as the &quot;perfect man.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        A number of years elapsed between the time of his rising popularity at the Chicago World&apos;s Fair in 1893 to the production of the first of the Ziegfeld &quot;Follies&quot; that ran through twenty-two editions with more and more beautiful choruses.
                                                        Perhaps, beneath the surface, the same idea underlay the two; that of exhibiting something so nearly perfect that people were attracted by their own desire to admire.

                                                        Mr. Ziegfeld was the son of Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld, who organized the Chicago Musical College, and recruited the symphony orchestra for Theodore Thomas. He was born on March 21, 1869, and grew up against a background of Beethoven, Schumann and Bach.

                                                        The younger Ziegfeld had a flair for the theatre, and was constantly active in amateur promotions. His father seized the World&apos;s Fair as an excellent excuse to give him a chance at the business in a professional way, sending him to Europe to obtain
                                                        performers for a program.

                                                        The result was a German band, a group of Russian signers and dancers, a Hungarian string orchestra and an English singer. The combined efforts of all of them produced nothing more than a financial failure.

                                                        In New York the younger Ziegfeld knew Maurice Grau, grand opera impresario, had under contract Eugene Sandow. The &quot;perfect man&quot; Mr. Grau esteemed as being worth $1,000 a week. Mr. Ziegfeld could not guarantee anybody $1,000 a week and so offered
                                                        10 per cent of the gross. The deal was made and Sandow went to the World&apos;s Fair.

                                                        The ability of the young manager as a glorifier was soon being used. One night Mrs. George Pullman and Mrs. Potter Palmer, leaders in Chicago society, paid Sandow a visit in his dressing room. The fact of the visit made a newspaper story, and other prominent
                                                        women found similar visits a sort of social obligation. Sandow&apos;s 10 per cent quickly ran up to about $3,600 a week, and Mr. Ziegfeld&apos;s esteem for publicity became practically ineradicable.

He brought Anna Held from Paris and presented her in his first production, &quot;A Parlor Match,&quot; in 1896. The show was lagging financially until
                                                        a milkman began suit against Miss Held for the milk in which she was said to have taken her daily bath, and when the news of that was spread, the actress became a great success.

In 1906 he returned with the idea of the Folies Bergere in the back of his mind. In 1907 he produced his first &quot;Follies.&quot;

He chose his chorus girls with fastidious care, he went through agonizing hours of rehearsals to make each number fit into his
                                                        conception of perfection as to dancing, music, costumes and scenery, and he operated on the theory that if anything is good, more of the same must be better.

His Career as &quot;Glorifier&quot;</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Ziegfeld, known as the &quot;glorifier of the American girl,&quot; began his career in professional theatrics with the profitable exploitation of the strong man, Eugene Sandow, as the &quot;perfect man.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        A number of years elapsed between the time of his rising popularity at the Chicago World&apos;s Fair in 1893 to the production of the first of the Ziegfeld &quot;Follies&quot; that ran through twenty-two editions with more and more beautiful choruses.
                                                        Perhaps, beneath the surface, the same idea underlay the two; that of exhibiting something so nearly perfect that people were attracted by their own desire to admire.

                                                        Mr. Ziegfeld was the son of Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld, who organized the Chicago Musical College, and recruited the symphony orchestra for Theodore Thomas. He was born on March 21, 1869, and grew up against a background of Beethoven, Schumann and Bach.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The younger Ziegfeld had a flair for the theatre, and was constantly active in amateur promotions. His father seized the World&apos;s Fair as an excellent excuse to give him a chance at the business in a professional way, sending him to Europe to obtain
                                                        performers for a program.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The result was a German band, a group of Russian signers and dancers, a Hungarian string orchestra and an English singer. The combined efforts of all of them produced nothing more than a financial failure.

                                                        In New York the younger Ziegfeld knew Maurice Grau, grand opera impresario, had under contract Eugene Sandow. The &quot;perfect man&quot; Mr. Grau esteemed as being worth $1,000 a week. Mr. Ziegfeld could not guarantee anybody $1,000 a week and so offered
                                                        10 per cent of the gross. The deal was made and Sandow went to the World&apos;s Fair.

                                                        The ability of the young manager as a glorifier was soon being used. One night Mrs. George Pullman and Mrs. Potter Palmer, leaders in Chicago society, paid Sandow a visit in his dressing room. The fact of the visit made a newspaper story, and other prominent
                                                        women found similar visits a sort of social obligation. Sandow&apos;s 10 per cent quickly ran up to about $3,600 a week, and Mr. Ziegfeld&apos;s esteem for publicity became practically ineradicable.

                                                        Mr. Ziegfeld tired of being Sandow&apos;s manager after about a year and a half, and came to New York. He brought Anna Held from Paris and presented her in his first production, &quot;A Parlor Match,&quot; in 1896. The show was lagging financially until
                                                        a milkman began suit against Miss Held for the milk in which she was said to have taken her daily bath, and when the news of that was spread, the actress became a great success.

Miss Held continued in the leading role appearing in &quot;Papa&apos;s Wife,&quot; &quot;The Little Duchess,&quot; and &quot;Miss

In 1906 he returned with the idea of the Folies Bergere in the back of his mind. In 1907 he produced his first &quot;Follies.&quot;

He chose his chorus girls with fastidious care, he went through agonizing hours of rehearsals to make each number fit into his
                                                        conception of perfection as to dancing, music, costumes and scenery, and he operated on the theory that if anything is good, more of the same must be better.

He then became the &quot;glorifier.&quot; Any girl who made her appearance
