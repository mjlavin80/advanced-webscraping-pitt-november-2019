The first indication that she had taken a turn for the worse, the nurse added, was a telephone call from the hospital
                                                        this afternoon saying that her condition had become suddenly grave.

                                                        Although Gertrude Stein could and did write intelligibly at times, her distinction rested on her use of words apart from their conventional meaning. Her emphasis on sound rather than sense is illustrated by her oft-quoted &quot;A rose is a rose is a rose.&quot;

Medical authorities compared her effusions to the rantings of the insane. The Hearst press inquired, &quot;Is Gertrude Stein not Gertrude Stein but somebody
                                                        else living and talking in the same body?&quot; Sinclair Lewis concluded she was conducting a racket.

Pupil of William James</b></p>

When

                                                        On her arrival in Paris, she met the artists, Picasso, Matisse and Bracque. Possessed of an independent income, she became a patron of these men, was influenced by them and handed along that influence to younger artists and writers, among them Ernest
                                                        Hemingway and the late Sherwood Anderson.

                                                        Her hobby was collecting the works of painters before they were famous. She claimed to have discovered Picasso, Juan Gris, Matisse and Bracque and introduced them to the French and American public. Her shrewd connoisseurship is indicated by the fact that
                                                        her collection of paintings was worth more than ten times what she paid for it.

Carl Van Vechten, the critic, classed
                                                        it with the greatest books of the age in his introduction to the Modern Library edition, which was a best seller.

                                                        with discourses on celebrities, art, literature, history and life in general and the genius of Gertrude Stein in particular.

She based her comments on the frequent talks she had had in Paris with American soldiers and concluded
                                                        that they would not become dissolute in the manner of the generation that lived in the wake of the first World War.

                                                    <p>PARIS, July 27--Gertrude Stein, famed woman writer and one of the most controversial figures of American letters, died at 6:30 o&apos; clock tonight (Paris time) at the American Hospital in Neuilly,
                                                        a suburb of Paris. Her age was 72. She had been suffering from cancer and had been in the hospital about a week.

                                                        At the bedside were Miss Alice B. Toklas, Miss Stein&apos;s nephew and niece and a physician identified only as Colonel Rogers.

                                                        Miss Stein&apos;s nurse declared that the author had been seriously ill for a considerable time, suffering from a run-down condition. The first indication that she had taken a turn for the worse, the nurse added, was a telephone call from the hospital
                                                        this afternoon saying that her condition had become suddenly grave.

Emphasized Sound in Language</b></p>

                                                        Although Gertrude Stein could and did write intelligibly at times, her distinction rested on her use of words apart from their conventional meaning. Her emphasis on sound rather than sense is illustrated by her oft-quoted &quot;A rose is a rose is a rose.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        Devotees of her cult professed to find her restoring a pristine freshness and rhythm to language. Medical authorities compared her effusions to the rantings of the insane. The Hearst press inquired, &quot;Is Gertrude Stein not Gertrude Stein but somebody
                                                        else living and talking in the same body?&quot; Sinclair Lewis concluded she was conducting a racket.

She was, in her own words,

Pupil of William James</b></p>

When
                                                        she sat down to write her final examination for him, she was tired, having been to the opera the night before. &quot;Dear Professor James,&quot; she wrote on her paper, &quot;I am so sorry but I
                                                        do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy today.&quot;

                                                        William James replied by postcard: &quot;Dear Miss Stein, I understand perfectly how you feel. I often feel like that myself.&quot; He gave her the highest mark in the course.

                                                        During this period she published in a psychological journal a paper recording her experiments in spontaneous automatic writing--the method, according to some critics, by which her books were produced.

                                                        On her arrival in Paris, she met the artists, Picasso, Matisse and Bracque. Possessed of an independent income, she became a patron of these men, was influenced by them and handed along that influence to younger artists and writers, among them Ernest
                                                        Hemingway and the late Sherwood Anderson.

                                                        Her hobby was collecting the works of painters before they were famous. She claimed to have discovered Picasso, Juan Gris, Matisse and Bracque and introduced them to the French and American public. Her shrewd connoisseurship is indicated by the fact that
                                                        her collection of paintings was worth more than ten times what she paid for it.

Carl Van Vechten, the critic, classed
                                                        it with the greatest books of the age in his introduction to the Modern Library edition, which was a best seller.

Toklas&quot; and &quot;Everybody&apos;s Autobiography,&quot; containing chitchat about Paris artists and American writers in Paris,
                                                        with discourses on celebrities, art, literature, history and life in general and the genius of Gertrude Stein in particular.

                                                        as the rest of the libretto, was produced.

                                                        As a lecturer, Miss Stein demonstrated her genius for self-press agentry by at once limiting her audiences to 500 because she &quot;didn&apos;t wish to be stared at as a marvel.&quot;

She based her comments on the frequent talks she had had in Paris with American soldiers and concluded
                                                        that they would not become dissolute in the manner of the generation that lived in the wake of the first World War.

                                                        Miss Stein&apos;s latest book was published only a week ago under the title &quot;Brewsie and Willie&quot; and was described by Charles Poore in last Sunday&apos;s Times Book Review as a book about what the GI&apos;s talked of when they gathered around
                                                        her feet in Paris. &quot;* * * or rather,&quot; Mr. Poore remarked, &quot;what she would like to think they talked about, for Miss Stein is a very powerful character and things are apt to change
                                                        dizzily when translated into Steinese.&quot;

                                                        A new Gertrude Stein play, &quot;Yes Is for a Very Young Man,&quot; which the author has described, despite the title, as &quot;a perfectly simple, straightforward play, completely understandable,&quot; is scheduled to be presented on Broadway this fall.
                                                        Apparently based in some degree on her &quot;Wars I Have Seen,&quot; the play will deal with the emotional conflicts which divided France and much of the world during the heyday of fascism.
