                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Ernest Hemingway achieved world-wide fame and influence as a writer by a combination of great emotional power and a highly individual style that could be parodied but never successfully imitated.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His lean and sinewy prose; his mastery of a kind of laconic, understated dialogue; his insistent use of repetition, often of a single word, or name--built up and transmitted an inner excitement to thousands of his readers. In his best work, the effect
                                                        was accumulative; it was as if the creative voltage increased as the pages turned.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Not all readers agreed on Mr. Hemingway; and his &quot;best&quot; single work will be the subject of literary debate for generations. But possibly &quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; published in 1952,
                                                        had the essence of the uncluttered force that drove his other stories. In it, character stands hard and clear, indomitable in failure. Man--an ordinary although an unusual man- -is a victim of, and
                                                        yet rises above, the elemental harshness of nature.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        The short novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953; it unquestionably moved the judges who awarded Mr. Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year. And it was an occasion for relief and joy among those devotees of the novelist to whom &quot;Across

                                                        A great deal of Mr. Hemingway&apos;s work showed a preoccupation--frequently called obsession--with violence and death. He loved guns; he was one of the great aficionados of the deadly bullfight. He identified with the adventures of partisan warfare;
                                                        he swung a burp-gun in guerrilla fighting.</p>

                                                        He wrote a great deal of hunting, fishing, prizefighting; with directness and vigor; with the accuracy of a man who has handled the artifacts of a sport, taken them apart, loved them. He was at times a hard liver and a hard drinker. But in a sense this
                                                        was all part of his being a hard and constant worker--at his profession of observing life and recording it faithfully as he saw it.</p>

                                                        Mr. Hemingway&apos;s fascination with the calibers of cartridges, and exactly what each could do to a living target, and physical conflict generally, brought a barb from Max Eastman in 1937. Mr. Eastman, a writer who had flexed his own muscles in Marxist
                                                        dialectics rather than in battle or in the hunt, wrote:</p>

                                                        &quot;Come out from behind that false hair on your chest, Ernest. We all know you.&quot;

                                                        When Mr. Hemingway and Mr. Eastman met in the New York offices of Charles Scribner&apos;s Sons, blows were exchanged as Mr. Hemingway bared his chest to prove that the hair was not false. In the later part of his life, Mr. Hemingway wore a beard, coarse
                                                        and grizzled. It became one of the most famous beards in the world, and a kind of symbol of the man himself.

                                                        After Mr. Hemingway became a successful writer, much effort was made by psychologists, amateur and professional, to discover why he wrote as he did. In spite of much rummaging around in his childhood and in his days as a young man in Paris, many of the
                                                        conclusions about him were contradictory. Mainly by trial and error, he had taught himself to write limpid English prose.

                                                        a middle-class suburb of Chicago.</p>

                                                        The date was July 21, 1899. Ernest Miller Hemingway was the second child of a family of six children; there were four sisters and a younger brother. His father was Dr. Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a large bearded physician who was more devoted to hunting
                                                        and fishing than to his practice.</p>

                                                        His mother was Grace Hall Hemingway, a religious-minded woman who sang in the choir of the First Congregational Church. She gave her son a cello, and for a year made him practice on it. But the boy&apos;s father had greater lures. He gave the boy a fishing
                                                        rod when he was 3 and a shot-gun when he was 10.</p>

                                                        With his graduation from Oak Park High, he completed his formal education. He read widely, however, and had a natural facility for languages.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was wartime, and torment for a spirited young man not to be in the fighting. Finally he managed to get to Italy, where he wangled his way into the fighting as a Red Cross ambulance driver with the Italian Army. Although he arrived too late for the
                                                        great Italian rout at Caporetto, he learned all about it and described it brilliantly in &quot;A Farewell to Arms,&quot; published in 1929.</p>

He received the Medaglia d&apos;Argento al
                                                        Valore Militare, a high Italian military decoration.

But, inexorably, he drifted to the expatriate Left Bank world of Paris. He had a letter from Sherwood Anderson to Gertrude
                                                        Stein, and he was soon one of the group of writers who frequented the bookstore of Sylvia Beach--Shakespeare &amp; Co., at 18 Rue de l&apos;Od&#xE8;on. Here he met, among many others, Andr&#xE8;
                                                        Gide and James Joyce.</p>

                                                        Mr. Joyce and Mr. Hemingway did a certain amount of drinking together. The author of &quot;Ulysses&quot; was a thin, wispy and unmuscled man with defective eyesight. When they were making the rounds of the cafes and Mr. Joyce became embroiled with a brawler,
                                                        as he frequently did, he would slip behind his hefty companion and cry, &quot;Deal with him, Hemingway. Deal with him.&quot;</p>

                                                        It was in Paris that Mr. Hemingway began to write seriously. He was greatly aided by the advice of the austere and sometimes curmudgeonish Miss Stein, whose unadorned style of writing influenced him greatly. If she was exacting, she was also sympathetic,
                                                        although she was inclined to deride Mr. Hemingway&apos;s mania for firearms and thereby often hurt his feelings.</p>

He lived in a tiny room and often subsisted on a few cents worth of fried potatoes a day. With the publication in
                                                        1926 of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; after three years of indifferent response to his work, he achieved sudden fame.</p>

The title is from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible and is in a passage that showed the seemingly meaningless coming and going of the sun,
                                                        the tides and the winds as the lives of his characters seemed to the author to come and go pointlessly.

                                                        In 1928, Mr. Hemingway returned to the United States, where he lived for the next ten years, mostly in Florida. He hated New York City and its literary life and kept away from it as much as he could. He was still only 30 when he published his highly successful
                                                        &quot;A Farewell to Arms.&quot;</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        For several years Mr. Hemingway hunted big game in Africa and did much shooting and fishing in different parts of the world. &quot;Winner Take Nothing&quot; was published in 1933 and &quot;The Green Hills of Africa&quot; in 1935.

                                                        The latter was one of the best contemporary accounts of the complex relationships between the hunter, the hunted and the African natives who are essential to the ritual of their confrontation. At the same time, the book told as much of Hemingway, the

                                                        &quot;... the feeling comes when you write well and truly of something and know impersonally you have written it that way and those who are paid to read it and report on it do not like the subject so they say it is all a fake, yet you know its value absolutely
                                                        ...&quot;

                                                        Like many American intellectuals, Mr. Hemingway offered some degree of support to Left-Wing movements during the Nineteen Thirties. In at least one of his books, &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1937)--his only full-length novel with an American setting--one
                                                        critic found he had spoken favorably of &quot;social consciousness,&quot; and to another he had sounded &quot;vaguely Socialist.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Action and Tragedy</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But more readers will remember the work as a tale of action and tragedy in the Florida Keys. They will recall not so much the social aspects of Harry Morgan&apos;s career, but probably the remarkable love affair between the doomed boatman and his slatternly
                                                        wife. Mr. Hemingway might stir the &quot;social consciousness&quot; of individual readers; but if so, he did it by exact characterization, never by didactics.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Nor had Mr. Hemingway ever joined the caf&#xE8;-sitters, who cheered on the progress of the Left. In 1936, with characteristic directness, he went to Spain. He covered the war for the North American Newspaper Alliance. And in 1940 his novel of the Spanish
                                                        Civil War, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; showed both that his own deepest sympathies were with the Loyalists, and that he was agonizingly aware of the destructive effect upon their cause of
                                                        the Communist commissars.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Indeed, the novel was in the broadest sense a lament for everyone involved in the conflict. Its striking title came from John Donne, who had reminded that no man is an island, and had written (in his seventeenth &quot;Devotion&quot;):
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;... never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the year World War II broke out, Mr. Hemingway took up residence in Cuba. But soon he was back in action in Europe, resuming the combat correspondence he had begun in Spain.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Hemingway was with the first of the Allied armed forces to enter Paris, where, as he put it, he &quot;liberated the Ritz&quot; Hotel. Later he was with the Fourth United States Infantry Division in an assault in the Huertgen Forest. The Bronze Star
                                                        was awarded to him for his semi-military services in this action.

                                                        In 1950, &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot;--the story of a frustrated and generally &quot;beat up&quot; United States infantry colonel who goes to Venice to philosophize, make love and die--disappointed critics. It touched off &quot;Across
                                                        the Street and Into the Grill,&quot; by E.B. White in The New Yorker. This was probably the supreme parody of Hemingway.

                                                        In 1950, The New Yorker also published a multi-part profile of Mr. Hemingway by Lillian Ross, who had spent several days with him in New York. It was a brilliant but savage series; it stirred much controversy and appears to have made more friends for
                                                        Mr. Hemingway than for Miss Ross. But the most impressive riposte came from the novelist himself. When the profile was published in hard covers, Mr. Hemingway in The New York Herald Tribune listed
                                                        it among the three books he had found most interesting that year.

It relied on the elemental drama of a fisherman who catches the greatest marlin of his life--only to have it eaten to the skeleton by sharks before he can get it to port.

Both Mr. Hemingway and his wife suffered injuries in the crack-up of the rescue plane; and a friend who visited them in Havana soon after found that the novelist&apos;s
                                                        injuries had been more severe than was generally supposed.

These included &quot;The Killers,&quot; an early gangster story, celebrated for its dialogue; &quot;The
