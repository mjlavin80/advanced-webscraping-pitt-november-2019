                                                        Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud and an eminent psychoanalyst in her own right, died at her London home today at the age of 86, her family said.

Focused on Child Analysis </b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &apos;&apos;I started out as an elementary-school teacher. I changed from that to the field of analysis and child analysis. From then on, I moved constantly back and forth, from the theoretical study of these problems to their practical application. I
                                                        agree that one has to have special luck to do this, and that most people do not have this.&apos;&apos;

                                                        This was Anna Freud&apos;s self-effacing summary of a long and productive life. It was true, of course, so far as it went; but it obscured the fact that Miss Freud, eminent in her own right, virtually invented the systematic study of the emotional and
                                                        mental life of the child and elaborated it in 50 years of observation, discussion and writing.

                                                        She also understated her powerful role as the guardian and elucidator of her father&apos;s revolutionary doctrine on the nature of the human psyche and its behavioral implications.

Earlier it was generally
                                                        assumed that children were arbitrarily motivated and that discipline was the surest path to healthy development.

                                                        Miss Freud suggested that a child developed emotionally through a number of stages - the oral, anal, urethral and phallic sexual stages that Sigmund Freud had outlined from circumstantial evidence. His argument for the existence of these stages was often
                                                        faulted because it had been based on the recollections of adults, and troubled ones at that.

Youngest of Six Freud Children

Close to her father, who was in his late 40&apos;s when she was growing up, Anna was keenly aware of the patriarchal figure
                                                        that her blackbearded father cut, of his rather rigid routines and of his happy sense of fun. She was aware, too, of her father&apos;s ostracism by the anti-Semitic scientific establishment in Vienna
                                                        despite his standing as a neurologist, a hostility so harsh that his masterwork, &apos;&apos;The Interpretation of Dreams,&apos;&apos; was ignored when it was published in 1900. It took eight years
                                                        to sell 600 copies of the book. </p>

Her first patients were adults, but she quickly shifted to children and was the leader of a small group of analysts who met regularly
                                                        to discuss the problems of children. In the group were Dr. Marianne Kris and Dr. Erik H. Erikson.

                                                        modest and self-effacing: with difficult children she showed inexhaustible patience; and to the work of the few she considered her colleagues she gave all manner of attention, often at the expense

The family was permitted to go to Britain after the payment of money and after Freud had signed a statement that he had been well treated.
                                                        To the statement he appended the ironic note, &apos;&apos;I can recommend the Gestapo to anyone.&apos;&apos; </p>

Understandably, she was suspicious (or fearful) lest her words be distorted, for she felt that vulgarization had contributed to misunderstandings

Not only had the Viennese scorned her father and refused to protest the German outrages against him, but they had never, in the years since World War II, honored his memory in any way. She relented only in
                                                        1971 for a meeting of the International Psychoanalytic Association and only after Vienna had officially expressed regrets for its treatment of the Freuds.

However, she did not wield absolute authority over child psychoanalysis. Her rival (and bete noire) was the late Melanie Klein,
                                                        the daughter of a Viennese physician, who was encouraged by Freud himself to study children.

Her therapy stressed protective, supportive and educational attitudes toward the child patient.
                                                        Among other things, she suggested how the classic modalities of adult psychoanalysis - transference, resistance, motivation and free association - could be utilized with children 4 years old and

To this end, she held seminars at the Yale Law School that dealt with penal
