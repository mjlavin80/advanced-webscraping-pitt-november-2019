&apos;One Step on a Long Road&apos;

He was, in Andre Malraux&apos;s phrase, &quot;the archwizard of modern
                                                        art,&quot; a man who, as a painter alone, produced well over 6,000 pictures. Some he splashed off in a few hours; others took weeks.

Crowding the walls of that venerable structure, the Picasso array drew exclamatory
                                                        throngs and moved Emily Genauer, the critic, to say, &quot;I think Picasso&apos;s new pictures are the fire of heaven.&quot;

That appraisal disturbed him, for he regarded himself,
                                                        with all his vagaries, as having created new insights into a seen and unseen world in which fragmentation of form was the basis for a new synthesis.

In every phase of its turbulent (and often violent) development he was either a daring pioneer or a gifted practitioner. The sheer variousness of his creations
                                                        reflected his probings of modern art for ways to communicate the multiplicity of its expressions; and so Picasso could not be categorized as belonging to this or that school, for he opened and tried
                                                        virtually all of them.

                                                        In his peripateticism he worked in oils, water-colors, pastels, gouaches, pencil and ink drawings and aquatints; he etched, made lithographs, sculptured, fashioned ceramics, put together mosaics and constructed murals.

An oil on canvas 11 1/4 feet high and 25 1/2 feet long, it is a majestic, stirring indictment of the destructiveness
                                                        of modern war. By contrast, another masterpiece was a simply and perfectly drawn white pigeon, &quot;The Dove,&quot; which was disseminated around the world as a symbol of peace. But masterpiece
                                                        or something not so exalted, virtually all Picasso were interesting and provocative. Praised or reviled, his work never evoked quiet judgments.

The mention of his name was sufficient to lure thousands, many of them only barely acquainted with any art, to museums and galleries and benefits. Reproductions and prints
                                                        were nailed up in homes all over the Western world, a certain mark of the owner&apos;s claim to culture. Originals were widely dispersed, both in museums and in the hands of collectors wealthy enough
                                                        to meet Picasso&apos;s prices. And they were steep. In 1965 he charged London&apos;s Tate Gallery $168,000 for &quot;Les Trois Danseuses,&quot; a painting he did in 1925. For a current painting,
                                                        private collectors felt that $20,000 was a steal and $35,000 not too much.</p>

                                                        For the last 50 years there has been no such thing as a cheap Picasso. Indeed, Leo and Gertrude Stein and Ambrose Vollard, a Paris dealer, may have been the last to get a Picasso for $30, and that was in 1906 and 1907.

He was probably the world&apos;s highest paid pieceworker, and there were
                                                        many years in which he garnered more than $1-million.

He released for sale about 40 of his paintings a year out of a production of hundreds, so that the market for his work
                                                        was never glutted. What he did not sell (and he said that many of these constituted the best from his palette) he squirreled away in bank vaults, studios, in a castle not far from the Riviera and
                                                        in empty rooms in his villa near Cannes. Picasso did not exactly hide his collection, for on occasion he permitted special friends to see it, to photograph it and to publish the results.

Worth a multimillion-dollar fortune, his works represented his Spanish period and were given in memory of Jaime Sabartes, his long-time secretary. In 1971
                                                        he gave an early constructed sculpture, &quot;Guitar,&quot; to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

                                                        what that was only a few intimates knew. He is said to have owned a great deal of real estate in France and to have made some excellent stock investments.

One of these was Fernande Olivier, who was his mistress for a number of years until 1912 and whose book about her experiences with him was not flattering. However, when
                                                        Picasso heard that her funds were running low, he saw to it that she was supplied with money.

Once, when the faking of Picassos was a small industry, a friend brought the painter a small work belonging to a poor artist for authentication so that it could be sold. &quot;It&apos;s
                                                        false,&quot; said Picasso.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        From a different source the friend brought another Picasso, and then a third. &quot;It&apos;s false,&quot; Picasso said each time.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Now listen, Pablo,&quot; the friend said of the third painting. &quot;I watched you paint this with my own eyes.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        As for himself, Picasso, from the time he began to take in appreciable sums until his death, lived like an Okie, albeit one who never had to worry about where his next meal or his next pair of trousers was coming from. &quot;I should like to live like
                                                        a poor man with a lot of money,&quot; he had said in the days when he was desperately poor and burning some of his paintings for heat.

Collector of Oddments

                                                        All his studios and homes--even the 18-room rambling La Californie at Cannes--were crammed and cluttered with junk--pebbles, rocks, pieces of glass, a hollow elephant&apos;s foot, a bird cage, African drums, wooden crocodiles, parts of old bicycles, ancient
                                                        newspapers, broken crockery, bullfight posters, old hats, weird ceramics. Picasso was a compulsive collector of oddments, and he never threw any of them away, or permitted anyone to move any object
                                                        once he had dropped it, tossed it or placed it somewhere.

                                                        To compound the chaos inside La Californie, the villa&apos;s lawn was home to clucking chickens, pigeons, at least one goat, dogs and children. They all disported among bronze owls, fountains and statuary scattered about the grounds. Freedom for animals
                                                        and children was a cardinal belief.

                                                        In later years this villa became a weekend residence, while his main home was Notre Dame de Vie in nearby Mougins. He also owned two chateaus, Vauvenargues, in Provence, and Boigeloup, in Normandy.

When he drove to Cannes or to Arles he invariably followed the same route; and when he lived in Paris he walked or rode the same streets in a fixed order.
                                                        When his Paris studio was at 7 rue des Grand-Augustins on the Left Bank, he almost always dined at La Brasserie Lipp on the Boulevard Saint-Germain and then cross the street to the Cafe Flore to
                                                        join friends in a mineral water and conversation before going home.

                                                        One Picasso day was, in outline, much like the next. He arose late, usually around 10 or 11, devoted two or three hours to friends, conversation, business, letters and lunch; then, at 3 or 4, he would go to his studio to work in Trappist silence, often
                                                        for 12 hours at a stretch, breaking off only for dinner around 10:30. Afterward, he sometimes worked until 2 or 3 in the morning.

                                                        When Miss Gilot was living with Picasso in Paris, she found that one of her most difficult tasks was to get him started on his day. &quot;He always woke up submerged in pessimism, and there was a definite ritual to be followed, a litany that had to be
                                                        repeated every day,&quot; she recalled in her book, &quot;Life With Picasso,&quot; published in 1964 by McGraw-Hill.

                                                        The rigamarole, as Miss Gilot recounts it, had largely to do with reassuring Picasso that his lamentations were falsely based. &quot;Well, I do despair,&quot; he would say in Miss Gilot&apos;s reconstruction, &quot;I&apos;m pretty nearly desperate. I
                                                        wonder, really, why I bother to get up. Why should I paint? Why should I continue to exist like this? A life like mine is unbearable.&quot;

                                                        Eventually, of course, Picasso permitted himself to be convinced that the world was not in conspiracy against him. Part of his maledicent mood could perhaps be traced to the physical aspects of his bedroom.

                                                        By early afternoon, Picasso, amid the bustle of the household and friends who came to pay him court, was bubbly and sunny. He liked not so much to converse as to talk, and his monologues were usually witty. His agile mind leaped from subject to subject,
                                                        and he had almost total recall.

                                                        He always had several projects in hand at the same time, and to each he seemed equally lavish with his talent. &quot;Painting is my hobby,&quot; he said. &quot;When I am finished painting, I paint again for relaxation.&quot;

Whenever he wanted pure color, he squeezed some from a tube onto the newspaper. At his feet and around the base of the easel were cans--mostly
                                                        tomato cans of various sizes--that held gray and neutral tones and other colors that he had previously mixed.

Sometimes he would say, &apos;I can&apos;t carry that plastic idea any further today,&apos; and then begin to work on another painting. He always had several half-dry unfinished canvases

Everything he saw, felt or did was for him an incomplete experience until it had been released and recorded. Once he was lunching on sole and happened to hold up the skeleton so that it caught his glance. He got
                                                        up from the table and returned almost immediately with a tray of clay in which he made an imprint of the skeleton. After lunch he drew colorful designs around the filigree of the bones, and the eventual
                                                        result was one of his most beautiful plates.

                                                        Picasso was a short, squat man with broad, muscular shoulders and arms. He was proud of his small hands and feet and of his hairy chest. In old age his body was firm and compact; and his cannon-ball head, which was almost bald, gleamed like bronze. Set
                                                        into it were deep black eyes of such penetration and alertness that they became his hallmark.

                                                        Photographs from his younger years showed him a handsome man with jet-black hair. Apart from the absence of hair, the description of him by Miss Olivier, his first long-term mistress, could have applied to the artist of later years.

A thick lock of hair, black and glossy, cut across his
                                                        intelligent, obstinate forehead. Half Bohemian, half workman in his clothes; his hair, which was too long, brushing the collar of his worn-out coat.&quot;</p>

                                                        Although at various times in his life Picasso dressed as a dandy, he was never comfortable in conventional clothes. He preferred corduroy or heavy velvet jackets, a T shirt and heavy trousers made of a blanket type of wool. These, after he could afford
                                                        them, were custom-made in odd designs. Sometimes he varied his get-up by wearing a striped jersey pull-over; and sometimes he just walked around in shorts. It was all a matter of whim.

Some called him &quot;maestro&quot; and fawned on him for the subsidiary fame that came from standing in his light. He was not above their company; and, indeed,
                                                        he seemed to have relished some who gave him favorable publicity.

Apart from fleeting affairs, there were seven women significant in his personal and artistic life. He married two of them, but his relationships with the five others were well recognized
                                                        and generally respected. Two of his companions bore three of his four children.

The two ran off together, and there followed a series of superb canvases expressing the artist&apos;s happiness. He called Miss Humbert &quot;Eva&quot;
                                                        and signed two of his works &quot;J&apos;aime Eva.&quot; Miss Humbert died in 1914.

He painted her in a Spanish mantilla, and he and Olga were married in 1918. Three years later a son, Paolo--Italian for Pablo or Paul--was born.

Separated for 20 Years

One reason, it is said, was that they had been married under a community property arrangement that would have obliged Picasso to divide his

Miss Roque had a rather wry sense of her role in the painter&apos;s life. A member of a movie crew that was

This bond influenced his painting and, after
                                                        1936 and the Spanish Civil War, propelled him for the first time into politics. His attachment to Spain was romantic and passionate; and the fact that he shunned Generalissimo Francisco Franco&apos;s

But with the outbreak of conflict in his homeland, Picasso became instinctively an aroused partisan of the Republican Government.

These showed the rebel leader as a perpetrator of symbolic horrors--himself ultimately transformed into a centaur and gored
                                                        to death by a bull. Countless copies of these etchings were dropped like propaganda leaflets over Franco territory.

At 4:30 on that cloudless Monday afternoon, German airmen, who had been provided to Franco by Adolf Hitler, descended on Guernica,
                                                        a town of no military importance, in a test of the joint effect of explosive and incendiary bombs on civilians. The carnage was enormous, and the news of it appalled the civilized world.

During the Nazi occupation of France in World War II, a German officer visited the artist&apos;s studio, where a large reproduction of the mural was on display.

Both were intended to arouse the conscience of mankind to the horrors

Although his decision seemed clearly motivated by the Spanish War and
                                                        the ensuing World War, there were many who thought at first that the action was another of Picasso&apos;s caprices.

Denounced by Soviet Critic

                                                        But Picasso&apos;s brand of Communism was not Moscow&apos;s, at least in the Kremlin&apos;s Stalinist period. In 1948, his works were denounced by Vladimir Kemenov, a Soviet art critic, as an &quot;apology for capitalistic esthetics that provokes the
                                                        indignation of the simple people, if not the bourgeoisie.&quot;

He treads the path of cosmopolitanism, of empty geometric forms. His every canvas
                                                        deforms man--his body and his face.&quot;

                                                        Picasso was pained but unmoved by the attack. &quot;I don&apos;t try to advise the Russians on economics. Why should they tell me how to paint?&quot; he remarked to a friend.
                                                    </p>

                                                        About that time, according to one account, an orthodox Soviet painter said to Picasso on being introduced, &quot;I have known of you for some time as a good Communist, but I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t like your painting.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        One day in 1949 Matisse came to visit Picasso, bringing a white fantail pigeon for his friend&apos;s cote. Virtually on the spot, Picasso made a naturalistic lithograph of the newcomer; and Louis Aragon, the Communist poet and novelist, who saw it shortly
                                                        afterward, realized its possibilities at once.

                                                        Picasso got into Communist hot water again, however, in 1953. This time the attack came from his French comrades. The occasion was Stalin&apos;s death and a crayon portrait that the artist sketched. The imaginative likeness of Stalin as a young man stirred
                                                        up the working-class members of the French party. Mr. Aragon, who had published it, felt obliged to recant in public, and Picasso was not amused.

And two years later the Soviet Union marked the painter&apos;s

                                                        and of Mercator-like projections of the human face and form.

                                                        The man who so largely created the special esthetic of modern art was born on the night of Oct. 25, 1881, in Malaga, on Spain&apos;s south coast.

                                                        Picasso&apos;s father was Jose Ruiz, an Andalusian who taught for small pay in the local school of arts and crafts. His mother was Maria Picasso, a Majorcan. Pablo could draw as soon as he could grasp a pencil, but as a pupil in the ordinary sense he
                                                        preferred looking at the clock to doing sums and reading. Save for art, he managed to avoid all but the rudiments of formal schooling. He was obstinate about this, as in other matters.

                                                        As a child, Picasso often accompanied his father to the bullfights. These made an indelible impression, for throughout his life bullring scenes and variations on them were a significant part of his work, recurring more persistently than any other single
                                                        symbol. His first oil, at the age of 9, was of the bullring.

By that time the youngster&apos;s talent was truly Mozartean, so obviously so that his father solemnly presented him with his own palette and brushes.
                                                        This confidence was justified when Pablo, at 15, competed for admission to the art school. A month was ordinarily allowed, but he completed his picture, a male nude, in a single day and was admitted
                                                        to classes in 1896.

During an illness he lived among the peasants of Catalonia, the poverty and barrenness of whose lives appalled him. From them and from the countryside, he said later, he learned &quot;everything

On one of these visits he met Max Jacob, who was, next to Pierre Reverdy, his most appreciative friend until his death in a Nazi concentration camp. Picasso
                                                        also became acquainted with Berthe Weill, the art dealer, who purchased some of his paintings, and Petrus Manach, another dealer, who was to support him briefly at the rate of $37.50 a month.

This period, ending about 1904, was characterized by his use of the color blue to depict fatalistically the haunting melancholy of dying clowns,
                                                        most of them in catatonic states, and agonized acrobats. &quot;La Mort d&apos; Arlequin&quot; is one of the most widely known of these.

                                                        When the artist moved into the Bateau-Lavoir, his rickety and drafty studio became an important meeting and talking place for persons later to be famous in arts and letters. In addition to Mr. Jacob there were Guillaume Apollinaire, the poet; Andre Salmon,

                                                        One of Picasso&apos;s lifelong habits, painting at night, started during this time, and for the simple reason that his day was frequently absorbed by friends and visitors. It was also the time of his two-year &quot;rose period,&quot; generally dated from
                                                        1904 to 1906, so-called because hues of that color dominated his pictures.

Leo and Gertrude did not so much discover the painter as popularize him. He, in turn, did a portrait of Gertrude with a face far from representational. When
                                                        Miss Stein protested that she didn&apos;t look like that, Picasso replied, &quot;But you will,&quot; and, indeed, in her old age Miss Stein came to resemble her picture.

                                                        The year 1907, the end of a very brief &quot;Negroid&quot; or &quot;African period,&quot; was a milestone for the painter, for it marked the birth of cubism in an oil of five distorted nudes called &quot;Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon.&quot;

                                                        With cubism, Picasso--along with Braque--rejected light and perspective, painting not what he saw, but what he represented to himself through analysis. (The name &quot;cubism&quot; was coined afterward, and it was based on the cube forms into which Picasso
                                                        and Braque tended to break up the external world.)

                                                        This was also the case when Picasso added a new dimension to cubism in 1911 or 1912 by inventing the collage by gluing a piece of imitation chair caning to a still life. Later he went on to an even less academic cubism, sometimes called rococo cubism.

                                                        among the best-known of these naturalistic pictures.

Some of his figures were endowed with several heads, displaced noses, mouths and eyes, overenlarged limbs. Turbulence and violence seemed
                                                        to be at the bottom of his feelings.

But again it was not a full preoccupation, and he was soon attacking his easel, this time with variations within a distinctive generally surrealistic
                                                        framework. One typical picture was &quot;Young Woman With a Looking-glass,&quot; painted in 1932.

Life was also quieter for him, especially after 1935 when Dora Maar helped put routine into his daily existence. She was also the model for a notable
                                                        series of portraits in which the Mercator projection principle was applied to the human face.

He rejected an opportunity to escape to the United States, and, instead, remained in Paris throughout the war, painting industriously amid considerable
                                                        personal hardship and the prying of Nazi soldiers. It was forbidden to exhibit his pictures or to print his name in the newspapers.

                                                        After the war, Picasso became enchanted by lithography, which he taught himself. In a short period he turned out more than 200 lithographs. He was at the same time painting, in Paris and in Antibes, and restlessly investigating pottery. Ceramics entranced
                                                        him, and his work with clay created an industry for the town of Vallauris, not far from the Riviera. In a single year he made and decorated 600 figures and vessels, all different.

                                                        His painting style, although it had moments of naturalism, contained wild reinventions of anatomy but in such an idiosyncratic way that surrealism or any other &quot;ism&quot; did not appear to apply. Picasso had isolated an idiom for himself.

Among Picasso&apos;s more notable variations were 10 on Cranach&apos;s &quot;David and Bathsheba,&quot; 15
                                                        on Delacroix&apos;s &quot;Femmes d&apos;Alger&quot; and 44 on Velazquez&apos;s &quot;Las Meninas.&quot;

                                                        He also painted scores of portraits of his wife in a variety of poses--on a bed fondling a cat, seated nude in his studio, reading. They were portraits only in the sense that they were vaguely representational of Jacqueline Roque, for the figure and the
                                                        face were almost always distorted.

As if in confirmation of this, Picasso told a visitor who admired the vigor of the

In 1967, when he was 86, &quot;Homage to Picasso,&quot; an exhibition of some of his works, drew throngs to museums here and abroad. His sculpture was given a special exhibition at the Museum of
                                                        Modern Art in New York. One example of his sculpture, &quot;Bust of Sylvette,&quot; is a 60-ton, sand-blasted work that rests in University Plaza, in downtown New York.

It was &quot;Desire Caught by the Tail,&quot; which he had written in three days on a sickbed in 1941. It was produced privately in Paris three years later with a cast that included the playwright,
                                                        Simone de Beauvoir, Valentine Hugo, Albert Camus, Raymond Queneau and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main prop was a big black box that served as a bed, bathtub and coffin for the two principal characters,
                                                        Fat Anxiety and Thin Anxiety. The play&apos;s action was earthy.

The objection was that some of the characters were expected to urinate on stage. Although this did not
                                                        take place, the play was thought overly suggestive.

                                                        The painter did not venture to St. Tropez for his play, nor did he often leave his hilltop villa in his last years. He seemed to feel the world slipping away from him, especially when his old friends died one after another. He shut himself up, refusing
                                                        to answer the telephone, for example, to mourn Ilya Ehrenburg in September, 1967.

                                                        But for the most part he painted. Rather than stand, he sat down, bending almost in half over his canvas. Age lines in his face underscored an intensity of purpose hardly abated by time. And as he painted his nostrils flared, his eyes widened, he frowned
                                                        and all the while his hand was never still.

                                                        He was, in the words of a friend, &quot;like a sturdy old oaken tub brimful of the wine of life.&quot;

Picasso--Symbol of a Conquest in Art
</b>
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    <b>By John Canaday
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Whatever else he was, Pablo Picasso was the most potent single force in the art of the 20th century. Matisse and Kandinsky might rival him as second leaders in the most violent revolution since the Renaissance. But neither of their revolutions was quite
                                                        as drastic, as far reaching, as varied in manner of assault and foray against tradition as Picasso&apos;s. And yet as soon as the word &quot;tradition&quot; is mentioned, Picasso must be thought
                                                        of as a colleague of the masters of the past as well as the artist who seemed most to reject them. It has always been typical of Picasso that he could not be captured within a single net. He was
                                                        this, he was that, he was the other--at one moment a poet, at the next an inspired buffoon; tender and romantic to the point of sentimentality, intellectual to the point of frigidity; now a cynic,
                                                        now a compassionate man; ebullient in one painting, despairing in another; exquisitely refined, and deliberately brutal.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        To think of Picasso as dead is next to impossible. Two generations ago he was already, with Matisse, the most commanding presence in art for an avant-garde that at that time was still small and was still opposed by the academic legions. But for a generation
                                                        Picasso has been the established symbol not only of the revolution of modern art but also of its conquest of the intellectuals, the collectors, the schools, and the last academic fortresses--the
                                                        museums. The conquest is so complete that there aer schoolchildren who know Picasso&apos;s name but have never hear of Giotto&apos;s. There are college students who can tell you more about the cubist
                                                        revolution than the Russian Revolution. Picasso turned the avant-garde into a mass audience.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The one thing that hold&apos;s Picasso&apos;s tremendous body of work together in spite of its unparalleled variety of styles is the sense it gives, in total retrospect, of restlessness, of dissatisfaction with any achievement, of constantly uncovering
                                                        something new, of throwing it away, picking it up again, inventing, recombining, always searching. Picasso once said, &quot;I do not seek--I find,&quot; but nothing he found ever satisfied him for
                                                        long.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In a critique, Hilton Kramer suggested that Picasso&apos;s preoccupation during the last years of his life with playing variations on masterpieces of the past was a way of satisfying his hunger for the monumental themes that the past offered its artists.
                                                        This must be true. Our century has somehow denied even its geniuses among painters themes comparable to the great religious cycles and the glorification of rulers that were once valid, and which
                                                        were extendable beyond their specific subjects into explorations of the human spirit.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In a century when faith is questioned and government is a matter of practical organization, we are accustomed to saying that modern artists have rejected the world and are content to deal with trivialities or with ivory-tower esthetic problems. But the
                                                        choice has not been theirs. Michelangelo surely could not find today within religion and society the impulses that generated the Sistine Ceiling, or any substitute for those impulses. It is significant
                                                        that Picasso, in his one great social statement, the greatest social statement made in painting in this century--his &quot;Guernica&quot;--does not celebrate a victory or an ideal but elegizes a
                                                        defeat. And now, with his death, the probability that Picasso was defeated by his century becomes clear.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One can no longer wonder what Picasso is going to do next: The line has been drawn. For 70 years his torrential energy constantly burst through conventional boundaries to discover new releases, but his genius, comparable to that of the old masters, never
                                                        found expressive consummation comparable to theirs. He produced, in a dozen manners, bodies of painting and sculpture that could have been the impressive life work of a dozen artists. He shifted,
                                                        in his single life as a man, from one creative life to another. We can say again and again that he exhausted a field of experiment--that he exhausted the poignant lyricism of the Blue and Rose periods,
                                                        exhausted the technical experiment of cubism, exhausted even the nostalgic recall of ancient Greece, exhausted his castigation of the violent and the monstrous, and exhausted them simply because
                                                        the inexhaustible themes of the past had been shattered into individually exhausted fragments.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But Picasso could not stop working. His creative energy welled up incessantly and demanded incessant release. He was left time and time again with no outlet for his fantastic genius except wit, showmanship and legerdemain. In wit, showmanship and legerdemain
                                                        he was unsurpassed, but the work that poured out seems sometimes to have been poured out desperately, in the double desperation of releasing intolerable creative pressures and the desperate realization
                                                        that this great force must be spent trivially.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But the triviality is only comparative. Picasso is being thought of here along with Giotto, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Rubens, for he was a gigantic figure in spite of everything. If he is also a tragic figure, it is by the conventions of tragedy
                                                        that demand a kingly figure fatally vulnerable to a tragic flaw. And in this case the flaw was not in the protagonist, but in the relationship of this century to its artists.
