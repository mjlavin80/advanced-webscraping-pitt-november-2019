                                                    <p>The life of Marilyn Monroe, the golden girl of the movies, ended as it began, in misery and tragedy.</p>
                                                    <p>Her death at the age of 36 closed an incredibly glamorous career and capped a series of somber events that began with her birth as an unwanted, illegitimate baby and went on and on, illuminated during
                                                        the last dozen years by the lightning of fame.</p>
                                                    <p>Her public life was in dazzling contrast to her private life.</p>
                                                    <p>The first man to see her on the screen, the man who made her screen test, felt the almost universal reaction as he ran the wordless scene. In it, she walked, sat down and lit a cigarette.
                                                    </p>

                                                        frame of the test radiated sex.&quot;

                                                    <p>Billy Wilder, the director, called it &quot;flesh impact.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Flesh impact is rare,&quot; he said. &quot;Three I remember who had it were Clara Bow, Jean Harlow and Rita Hayworth. Such girls have flesh which photographs like flesh. You feel you can reach
                                                        out and touch it.&quot;

                                                    <p>One of her most exasperating quirks was her tardiness. She was, during the years of her fame, anywhere from one to twenty-four hours late for appointments. Until lately, she managed to get away with

                                                    <p>Mr. Dougherty said after their divorce four years later, in 1946, that she had been a &quot;wonderful&quot; housekeeper.

                                                    <p>She also revealed her sense of humor. When asked by a woman journalist, &quot;You mean you didn&apos;t have anything on?&quot; she replied breathlessly:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, I had the radio on.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>One of her most exasperating quirks was her tardiness. She was, during the years of her fame, anywhere from one to twenty-four hours late for appointments. Until lately, she managed to get away with

                                                    <p>The tardiness, the lack of responsibility and the fears began to show more and more through the glamorous patina as Miss Monroe&apos;s career waxed.</p>
