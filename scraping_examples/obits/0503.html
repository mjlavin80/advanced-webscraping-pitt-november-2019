                                                    <p>For five years Golda Meir was Prime Minister of Israel. Her often-stated ambition was to see Israel accepted by its Arab neighbors and living in peace. With firmness and determination, she sought but
                                                        failed to achieve those aims. &quot;We say &apos;peace&apos; and the echo comes back from the other side, &apos;war,&apos;&quot; she once lamented. &quot;We don&apos;t want wars even when we win.&quot;</p>

                                                        It was her fate to lead the Israeli Government when the forces of Egypt and Syria attacked in October 1973 in a costly war that Israel almost lost before it could mobilize and fight to an inconclusive end, in which both sides would claim tenuous victories.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir left office in 1974. When President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt made the dramatic announcement of his decision to visit Jerusalem in November 1977, Mrs. Meir-- who was in New York for the opening

                                                    <p>When President Sadat arrived in Israel, he seemed more at ease with her than with any of the other prominent Israelis he saw, and she gave him a gift for a newly born grandchild. He later confided to
                                                        interviewers that he would have preferred to negotiate with her because he regarded her as &quot;a tough old lady&quot; who had the will to persevere on the road to peace.</p>
                                                    <p>Her toughness was legendary while she ran the Israeli Cabinet. After she left, the Labor Party, which she had led, became more fractious than ever and, beset by charges of corruption, went down to a
                                                        stunning defeat in the spring of 1977 at the hands of a right- wing coalition led by Menachem Begin, who became Prime Minister. After that, the Labor Party experienced a bewildering slide into something
                                                        close to irrelevance in the political arena.</p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir had a gift for making complex issues appear simple and expressing her views in plain but emotional terms: &quot;Our generation reclaimed the land, our children fought the war and our grandchildren
                                                        should enjoy the peace.&quot; Even when she spoke to an audience of thousands, it could sound as though she was speaking in her living room.</p>
                                                    <p>At a small gathering in New York some years ago, Mrs. Meir heard an overdramatized version of an appeal she had made to President John F. Kennedy for arms. &quot;If I had spoken to Kennedy so beautifully,&quot;
                                                        she commented, &quot;I would have gotten more arms.&quot; Once when an aide suggested a statement to make to waiting reporters, she rejoined, &quot;You can&apos;t improve on saving nothing.&quot;
                                                        Her mother used to advise: &quot;When you say no, you never regret it.&quot;

Her first memory was of her father nailing boards over the front door during rumors that a pogrom was imminent. &quot;If there is any explanation necessary for the direction which
                                                        my life has taken,&quot; she said years later, &quot;perhaps it is the desire and the determination to save Jewish children from a similar scene and from a similar experience.&quot;

                                                        more. But we who lived through it have a complex of gas chambers.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>In Russia life was not far from death. &quot;I was always a little too cold outside and a little too empty inside,&quot; she recalled. Her food was sometimes given to her younger sister, Zipke; their
                                                        older sister, Sheyna, often fainted from hunger.</p>
                                                    <p>In 1906, the family emigrated to the United States, where Golda&apos;s father had spent three years in Milwaukee saving to prepare the way. When he could find employment he worked as a carpenter, and
                                                        his wife set herself up in a small grocery, the bane of Golda&apos;s existence. Beginning at age 8, Golda had to run the store each morning while her mother was at the market buying supplies. The
                                                        child arrived late for school every day, having cried all the way from home.

                                                    <p>At age 11 she organized her first public meeting and gave her first public speech, to raise money for school textbooks. Not many years later her mother pressed her to give up the idea of high school,
                                                        spend her days working in the grocery and marry a much older man, a Mr. Goodstein. At age 14 Golda ran away to live with Sheyna in Denver, where she met her future husband, a gentle, erudite sign
                                                        painter named Morris Myerson, another emigre from Russia.</p>
                                                    <p>After an argument with Sheyna, Golda, now 16, moved out and was given shelter by two of Sheyna&apos;s friends. She got a job measuring skirt linings, and in later years found herself involuntarily glancing

                                                        there were attacks on Jews in the Ukraine and in Poland, she helped organize a protest march in Milwaukee. Her home became a center for visitors from Palestine. &quot;I knew that I was not going

                                                        about freedom in America, she loved her first adopted country, but she never knew a moment of homesickness for it.

                                                        no oil.&quot; The only heavy industry in Palestine was the manufacture of chocolate, she recalled. &quot;Why does it taste so sandy?&quot; she asked, and was told that sand was the only natural resource.</p>
                                                    <p>The new immigrants--she, her husband, her sister Sheyna, with whom she had been reconciled, and Sheyna&apos;s children--had no one to help them. Many others found the struggle too much and left, and
                                                        Mrs. Meir was to say later: &quot;I have always felt sorry for those people, because, to my mind, the loss has always been theirs.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>Golda and Morris Myerson applied to join Kibbutz Merhavia, whose name means &quot;God&apos;s wide spaces,&quot; and were rejected because a majority of the members suspected that she would not be willing
                                                        to do physical labor. Furious at this attitude, she persisted and was finally accepted. Afterward, she said jokingly that she was accepted only because of her phonograph and records.

                                                        afraid to be in a room with even one chicken.&quot;</p>

                                                        and distributed cookies twice a week instead of once. For Sabbath eve supper she improvised a tablecloth from a sheet and even put flowers on the table.

                                                        her old phonograph, she wrote later: &quot;I even wonder sometimes whether it might not have been a relief for Merhavia to accept the dowry without the bride.&quot;

They moved briefly to Tel Aviv, then to Jerusalem, where Golda Myerson gave birth to a son, Menachem, and a daughter, Sarah, endowing them with the inalienable right
                                                        to share the family&apos;s poverty. Mrs. Myerson spent hours each day doing the laundry for Menachem&apos;s nursery school to pay for his tuition. &quot;Was this what it was all about?&quot; she
                                                        asked herself. &quot;Poverty, drudgery and worry?&quot;

Her marriage was breaking up, and accepting the job, which required frequent travel, was tantamount to recognizing
                                                        the breakup. She and the children moved to a tiny apartment in Tel Aviv, and for years she slept there on the living-room couch. Her husband died in 1951; characteristically, she was away at the

                                                        she replied. &quot;God knows there is always enough to cry about.&quot;

                                                        again to raise more money. At home, the new state confounded the expectations of its Arab enemies by holding off their attacks and establishing its authority.

                                                        She did know a lot about communal living, however, and when she took up her post she ran the embassy as a kibbutz, with everyone, including the envoy, taking turns at the chores.

                                                    <p>Q: Your grandson, Gideon Meir, age 7, says that you are the best gefilte-fish maker in Israel. What is your recipe?
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A: My grandson - I&apos;m afraid he&apos;s not very objective about me. I&apos;m not very objective about him, either.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Ready to Go Anywhere for Peace</b>
                                                    <p>On Mr. Eshkol&apos;s death in February 1969 the Labor Party selected her as its candidate for Prime Minister. That was not exactly the retirement she had in mind--&quot;Being 70 is not a sin,&quot; she
                                                        said; &quot;It&apos;s not a joy, either&quot;--but she accepted and won Parliament&apos;s vote of confidence.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Pressing for a meeting with the Arabs, she proclaimed her readiness to go to any length except national suicide to secure peace. &quot;If Nasser chooses New York for negotiations, it&apos;s all right,&quot;
                                                        she said. &quot;If he wants to go to New Jersey, that&apos;s fine too. If he says Geneva, we agree. I&apos;m even prepared to go to Cairo--how about that!--to sit down at the table.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Arab officials will have to overcome the shock of meeting us not on the battlefield but at the negotiating table,&quot; she added.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Suppose we want to return territory we have taken,&quot; she noted. &quot;To whom? We can&apos;t send it to Nasser by parcel post.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Upon the death of President Nasser in September 1970, Israeli officials saw a new opportunity for peace under Mr. Sadat, his successor. In 1972 President Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania told Mrs. Meir that
                                                        President Sadat was agreeable to a meeting, and when she urged that it be arranged, Mr. Ceausescu said he would be in touch; but she related later that she never heard from him again.</p>
                                                    <b>Telling the Pope How It Was</b>
                                                    <p>In January 1973 she did hear from the Vatican, which has never recognized Israel, that Pope Paul VI was ready to receive her. &quot;Before we went to the audience,&quot; she recalled, &quot;I said to
                                                        our people: &apos;Listen, what&apos;s going on here? Me, the daughter of Moshe Mabovitch the carpenter, going to meet the Pope of the Catholics?&apos; So one of our people said to me, &apos;Just
                                                        a moment, Golda, carpentry is a very respectable profession around here.&apos;&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Pope had hardly opened the conversation before the daughter of Moshe Mabovitch spoke her mind. &quot;I didn&apos;t like the opening at all,&quot; she recalled. &quot;His Holiness had said he found it hard to understand that the Jewish people, who
                                                        should be merciful, behaved so fiercely in its own country. I can&apos;t stand it when we are talked to like that, so I said to the Pope: &apos;Your Holiness, do you know what my earliest memory
                                                        is? A pogrom in Kiev. When we were merciful and when we had no homeland and when we were weak, we were led to the gas chambers.&apos;&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Too Apprehensive for Tears</b>
                                                    <p>She had decided to look the Pope in the eye, and not lower her eyes under any circumstances. &quot;There were moments of tension,&quot; she said. &quot;I felt that I was saying what I was saying to the
                                                        man of the cross, who heads the church whose symbol is the cross, under which Jews were killed for generations.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir knew many bitter moments and difficult meetings, few more galling than her encounter with Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria, whose background was Jewish but who had acceded to an Arab request
                                                        that an Austrian transit camp for Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel be closed. She could not persuade him to change his mind, and she never forgave him.</p>
                                                    <p>The greatest crisis of her years as Prime Minister came with the war in October 1973. Although she felt that Egypt and Syria might be planning an attack, she accepted the reassurances of her military
                                                        leaders and held off mobilizing the reserves. &quot;I shall live with that terrible knowledge for the rest of my life,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In the first days of the war, with Israeli forces overwhelmed by superior numbers and firepower, Mrs. Meir lived endless hours of apprehension and exhaustion. &quot;I couldn&apos;t even cry when I was
                                                        alone,&quot; she wrote later. Finally, when Egypt and Syria faced defeat, the Russians, as they had in 1967, demanded a cease-fire, to which the United Nations agreed.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>During subsequent negotiations between the Unites States and Israel, Mrs. Meir came to have ambivalent feelings about the role of Henry A. Kissinger, the Secretary of State. To force Israeli compliance
                                                        with American wishes, the United States threatened economic retaliation and the negotiations were broken off.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>By this time, Mrs. Meir had handed over the Government to Yitzhak Rabin, having told the party leadership: &quot;It is beyond my strength to continue carrying this burden.&quot; When she left office,
                                                        on June 4, 1974, she was 76 years old, but she was still not prepared to go into that political nunnery, so she went on speaking her mind.</p>
                                                    <p>During a talk at Princeton a student asked her, in a reference to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian guerrilla leader: &quot;What if Arafat offered to recognize Israel?&quot; The prospect seemed so ludicrous
                                                        that Mrs. Meir, bowdlerizing, replied: &quot;There&apos;s a saying in Yiddish, &apos;If my grandmother had had wheels, she would have been a carriage.&apos;&quot; When another student asked for details
                                                        of the Soviet Union&apos;s presence in the Middle East in men and in missile bases, she replied: &quot;It was too much before and it&apos;s too much now.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>At the end of her life she was still feeling guilty about the years during which she had neglected her children and about her failure to devote herself to the kibbutz rather than to public life. &quot;There
                                                        is a type of woman who cannot remain at home,&quot; she once wrote. &quot;In spite of the place her children and family fill in her life, her nature demands something more; she cannot divorce herself
                                                        from the larger social life. She cannot let her children narrow her horizon. For such a woman there is no rest.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p></p>

                                                    <h5>By ISRAEL SHENKER</h5>
                                                    <p>For five years Golda Meir was Prime Minister of Israel. Her often-stated ambition was to see Israel accepted by its Arab neighbors and living in peace. With firmness and determination, she sought but
                                                        failed to achieve those aims. &quot;We say &apos;peace&apos; and the echo comes back from the other side, &apos;war,&apos;&quot; she once lamented. &quot;We don&apos;t want wars even when we win.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was her fate to lead the Israeli Government when the forces of Egypt and Syria attacked in October 1973 in a costly war that Israel almost lost before it could mobilize and fight to an inconclusive end, in which both sides would claim tenuous victories.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;We do not rejoice in victories,&quot; she said. &quot;We rejoice when a new kind of cotton is grown and when strawberries bloom in Israel.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir left office in 1974. When President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt made the dramatic announcement of his decision to visit Jerusalem in November 1977, Mrs. Meir-- who was in New York for the opening
                                                        of the Broadway show &quot;Golda,&quot; an account of her life starring Anne Bancroft--hailed it as a brilliant move but advised a wait-and-see attitude pending more concrete results.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Preferred the &apos;Tough Old Lady&apos;</b>
                                                    <p>When President Sadat arrived in Israel, he seemed more at ease with her than with any of the other prominent Israelis he saw, and she gave him a gift for a newly born grandchild. He later confided to
                                                        interviewers that he would have preferred to negotiate with her because he regarded her as &quot;a tough old lady&quot; who had the will to persevere on the road to peace.</p>
                                                    <p>Her toughness was legendary while she ran the Israeli Cabinet. After she left, the Labor Party, which she had led, became more fractious than ever and, beset by charges of corruption, went down to a
                                                        stunning defeat in the spring of 1977 at the hands of a right- wing coalition led by Menachem Begin, who became Prime Minister. After that, the Labor Party experienced a bewildering slide into something
                                                        close to irrelevance in the political arena.</p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir had a gift for making complex issues appear simple and expressing her views in plain but emotional terms: &quot;Our generation reclaimed the land, our children fought the war and our grandchildren
                                                        should enjoy the peace.&quot; Even when she spoke to an audience of thousands, it could sound as though she was speaking in her living room.</p>
                                                    <p>At a small gathering in New York some years ago, Mrs. Meir heard an overdramatized version of an appeal she had made to President John F. Kennedy for arms. &quot;If I had spoken to Kennedy so beautifully,&quot;
                                                        she commented, &quot;I would have gotten more arms.&quot; Once when an aide suggested a statement to make to waiting reporters, she rejoined, &quot;You can&apos;t improve on saving nothing.&quot;
                                                        Her mother used to advise: &quot;When you say no, you never regret it.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        Golda Mabovitch was born on May 3, 1898 in Kiev, in the Russian Empire. Her first memory was of her father nailing boards over the front door during rumors that a pogrom was imminent. &quot;If there is any explanation necessary for the direction which

                                                        painter named Morris Myerson, another emigre from Russia.</p>

                                                        there were attacks on Jews in the Ukraine and in Poland, she helped organize a protest march in Milwaukee. Her home became a center for visitors from Palestine. &quot;I knew that I was not going

                                                        no oil.&quot; The only heavy industry in Palestine was the manufacture of chocolate, she recalled. &quot;Why does it taste so sandy?&quot; she asked, and was told that sand was the only natural resource.</p>

                                                        Mrs. Meir was to say later: &quot;I have always felt sorry for those people, because, to my mind, the loss has always been theirs.&quot;</p>

                                                        to do physical labor. Furious at this attitude, she persisted and was finally accepted. Afterward, she said jokingly that she was accepted only because of her phonograph and records.

                                                        her old phonograph, she wrote later: &quot;I even wonder sometimes whether it might not have been a relief for Merhavia to accept the dowry without the bride.&quot;

They moved briefly to Tel Aviv, then to Jerusalem, where Golda Myerson gave birth to a son, Menachem, and a daughter, Sarah, endowing them with the inalienable right
                                                        to share the family&apos;s poverty. Mrs. Myerson spent hours each day doing the laundry for Menachem&apos;s nursery school to pay for his tuition. &quot;Was this what it was all about?&quot; she
                                                        asked herself. &quot;Poverty, drudgery and worry?&quot;

Her marriage was breaking up, and accepting the job, which required frequent travel, was tantamount to recognizing
                                                        the breakup. She and the children moved to a tiny apartment in Tel Aviv, and for years she slept there on the living-room couch. Her husband died in 1951; characteristically, she was away at the

                                                        she replied. &quot;God knows there is always enough to cry about.&quot;

                                                        who was to play a vital role in securing Israeli independence, fixed the lines of Jewish opposition: &quot;We shall fight Hitler as if there were no white paper and fight the white paper as if there

Mrs. Meir defended him: &quot;A leader
                                                        who doesn&apos;t hesitate before he sends his nation to battle is not fit to be a leader.&quot; To young volunteers who rushed to Israel during the six-day war and were preparing to return home,

                                                    <p>Upon the death of President Nasser in September 1970, Israeli officials saw a new opportunity for peace under Mr. Sadat, his successor. In 1972 President Nicolae Ceausescu of Rumania told Mrs. Meir that
                                                        President Sadat was agreeable to a meeting, and when she urged that it be arranged, Mr. Ceausescu said he would be in touch; but she related later that she never heard from him again.</p>
                                                    <b>Telling the Pope How It Was</b>
                                                    <p>In January 1973 she did hear from the Vatican, which has never recognized Israel, that Pope Paul VI was ready to receive her. &quot;Before we went to the audience,&quot; she recalled, &quot;I said to
                                                        our people: &apos;Listen, what&apos;s going on here? Me, the daughter of Moshe Mabovitch the carpenter, going to meet the Pope of the Catholics?&apos; So one of our people said to me, &apos;Just
                                                        a moment, Golda, carpentry is a very respectable profession around here.&apos;&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Pope had hardly opened the conversation before the daughter of Moshe Mabovitch spoke her mind. &quot;I didn&apos;t like the opening at all,&quot; she recalled. &quot;His Holiness had said he found it hard to understand that the Jewish people, who
                                                        should be merciful, behaved so fiercely in its own country. I can&apos;t stand it when we are talked to like that, so I said to the Pope: &apos;Your Holiness, do you know what my earliest memory
                                                        is? A pogrom in Kiev. When we were merciful and when we had no homeland and when we were weak, we were led to the gas chambers.&apos;&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b>Too Apprehensive for Tears</b>
                                                    <p>She had decided to look the Pope in the eye, and not lower her eyes under any circumstances. &quot;There were moments of tension,&quot; she said. &quot;I felt that I was saying what I was saying to the
                                                        man of the cross, who heads the church whose symbol is the cross, under which Jews were killed for generations.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mrs. Meir knew many bitter moments and difficult meetings, few more galling than her encounter with Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria, whose background was Jewish but who had acceded to an Arab request
                                                        that an Austrian transit camp for Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel be closed. She could not persuade him to change his mind, and she never forgave him.</p>
                                                    <p>The greatest crisis of her years as Prime Minister came with the war in October 1973. Although she felt that Egypt and Syria might be planning an attack, she accepted the reassurances of her military
                                                        leaders and held off mobilizing the reserves. &quot;I shall live with that terrible knowledge for the rest of my life,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In the first days of the war, with Israeli forces overwhelmed by superior numbers and firepower, Mrs. Meir lived endless hours of apprehension and exhaustion. &quot;I couldn&apos;t even cry when I was
                                                        alone,&quot; she wrote later. Finally, when Egypt and Syria faced defeat, the Russians, as they had in 1967, demanded a cease-fire, to which the United Nations agreed.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>During subsequent negotiations between the Unites States and Israel, Mrs. Meir came to have ambivalent feelings about the role of Henry A. Kissinger, the Secretary of State. To force Israeli compliance
                                                        with American wishes, the United States threatened economic retaliation and the negotiations were broken off.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>By this time, Mrs. Meir had handed over the Government to Yitzhak Rabin, having told the party leadership: &quot;It is beyond my strength to continue carrying this burden.&quot; When she left office,
                                                        on June 4, 1974, she was 76 years old, but she was still not prepared to go into that political nunnery, so she went on speaking her mind.</p>
                                                    <p>During a talk at Princeton a student asked her, in a reference to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian guerrilla leader: &quot;What if Arafat offered to recognize Israel?&quot; The prospect seemed so ludicrous
                                                        that Mrs. Meir, bowdlerizing, replied: &quot;There&apos;s a saying in Yiddish, &apos;If my grandmother had had wheels, she would have been a carriage.&apos;&quot; When another student asked for details
                                                        of the Soviet Union&apos;s presence in the Middle East in men and in missile bases, she replied: &quot;It was too much before and it&apos;s too much now.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>At the end of her life she was still feeling guilty about the years during which she had neglected her children and about her failure to devote herself to the kibbutz rather than to public life. &quot;There
                                                        is a type of woman who cannot remain at home,&quot; she once wrote. &quot;In spite of the place her children and family fill in her life, her nature demands something more; she cannot divorce herself
                                                        from the larger social life. She cannot let her children narrow her horizon. For such a woman there is no rest.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p></p>
