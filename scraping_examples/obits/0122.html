                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Fred M. Vinson enjoyed a noteworthy career in each of the three branches of the Federal Government--legislative, executive and judicial. In twelve years in the House of Representatives he won wide renown
                                                        as a tax and fiscal expert. Then, in World War II, he served in top administrative posts, as Economic Stabilizer, Federal Loan Administrator, Assistant President, and Secretary of the Treasury. Finally,
                                                        in 1946, he was appointed by President Truman as Chief Justice of the United States.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In all three fields he distinguished himself by the exercise of his most characteristic quality, his exceptional ability as a negotiator, a trouble-shooter, a reconciler of conflicting views, a man who could reduce warring factions to at least outward
                                                        harmony and so get things done.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Probably his finest achievement was the application of this soothing technique to the bitter personal feuds and doctrinal disputes that had rent the Supreme Court for a long time before his appointment. Within a year after he became Chief Justice, members
                                                        of the august tribunal who previously had refused to speak were bowing to each other from the waist. What was more important, the court had regained the public confidence and respect which it had
                                                        lost because of the dissension in its midst.

                                                        But it was this highly commended trait that caused trouble for the Chief Justice and his good friend President Truman in 1948. Then the President, without pondering all the implications and potential repercussions, decided it would be a fine idea to send
                                                        his Great Negotiator to Moscow to negotiate personally with Premier Stalin for the lifting of the Soviet blockade of Berlin and peaceful relations generally.

                                                        But General of the Army George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, had previously taken the lead in breaking off direct negotiations with the Russians, and in referring the Berlin matter to the Security Council. Amid a flood of protest from all sides
                                                        that the President&apos;s proposal was embarrassing our allies, breaking the united front of the Western nations, and providing the Communists with a new weapon for their &quot;peace&quot; propaganda,
                                                        Secretary Marshall rushed back from a Paris meeting of the Security Council and succeeded in talking the President out of the idea. Mr. Truman said later he had not intended any appeasement but merely
                                                        to try to convince Marshal Stalin of our sincerity.

                                                        The Chief Justice&apos;s friendship with the President was one of the most important facts of both their lives. This friendship began when both were in Congress, Mr. Truman in the Senate and Mr. Vinson in the House. It developed into an especially close
                                                        relationship after the death of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945.

The Vinson family would go to the White House for Thanksgiving dinner with the Trumans. Both the President and the Chief Justice had telephones by their
                                                        beds, and regularly held long talks at night, in which the President received Mr. Vinson&apos;s advice and counsel on many problems. Throughout the Truman Administration Mr. Vinson was regarded as
                                                        one of the real inner circle at the White House, one of the &quot;top ten.&quot;

The Chief Justice was generally regarded in Washington as the President&apos;s choice to succeed him
                                                        in 1952 if Mr. Truman himself did not run, but Mr. Vinson let it be known he had no Presidential ambitions, and early in 1952 it was reported he had indicated to the President he preferred not to
                                                        be a candidate.

At the time the Supreme Court was split into two warring groups, and beset with personal as well as
                                                        legal animosities. One was headed by Associate Justice Hugo Black, a former Senator from Alabama, the other by Associate Justice Robert G. Jackson of New York, a former Attorney General of the United
                                                        States. Both were appointees of President Roosevelt.

President Truman and
                                                        others in high places in Washington had been familiar with the situation before, and there is reason to believe that Mr. Vinson was named to the court primarily to bring peace and restore some of

The vacancy had been caused
                                                        by President Roosevelt&apos;s ouster of Jesse Jones as Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan Administrator to make a place in the Cabinet for Henry A. Wallace, whom the Democrats had refused to

                                                        were to be welcomed, not deplored. They conclusively proved that the United States was a democracy, he explained, adding that regular unanimity among judges is possible only in Fascist and Communist

                                                        the reduction of bail. He wrote that the United States in fighting communism must not accept Communist methods, and added that Communists, like everyone else, were entitled to reasonable bail unless
                                                        the Government could prove evidence justifying exceptional bail.

                                                    <h2>Vinson Excelled In Federal Posts</h2>
                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>Fred M. Vinson enjoyed a noteworthy career in each of the three branches of the Federal Government--legislative, executive and judicial. In twelve years in the House of Representatives he won wide renown
                                                        as a tax and fiscal expert. Then, in World War II, he served in top administrative posts, as Economic Stabilizer, Federal Loan Administrator, Assistant President, and Secretary of the Treasury. Finally,
                                                        in 1946, he was appointed by President Truman as Chief Justice of the United States.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In all three fields he distinguished himself by the exercise of his most characteristic quality, his exceptional ability as a negotiator, a trouble-shooter, a reconciler of conflicting views, a man who could reduce warring factions to at least outward
                                                        harmony and so get things done.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Probably his finest achievement was the application of this soothing technique to the bitter personal feuds and doctrinal disputes that had rent the Supreme Court for a long time before his appointment. Within a year after he became Chief Justice, members
                                                        of the august tribunal who previously had refused to speak were bowing to each other from the waist. What was more important, the court had regained the public confidence and respect which it had
                                                        lost because of the dissension in its midst.

                                                        But it was this highly commended trait that caused trouble for the Chief Justice and his good friend President Truman in 1948. Then the President, without pondering all the implications and potential repercussions, decided it would be a fine idea to send
                                                        his Great Negotiator to Moscow to negotiate personally with Premier Stalin for the lifting of the Soviet blockade of Berlin and peaceful relations generally.

                                                        But General of the Army George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, had previously taken the lead in breaking off direct negotiations with the Russians, and in referring the Berlin matter to the Security Council. Amid a flood of protest from all sides
                                                        that the President&apos;s proposal was embarrassing our allies, breaking the united front of the Western nations, and providing the Communists with a new weapon for their &quot;peace&quot; propaganda,
                                                        Secretary Marshall rushed back from a Paris meeting of the Security Council and succeeded in talking the President out of the idea. Mr. Truman said later he had not intended any appeasement but merely
                                                        to try to convince Marshal Stalin of our sincerity.

                                                        The Chief Justice&apos;s friendship with the President was one of the most important facts of both their lives. This friendship began when both were in Congress, Mr. Truman in the Senate and Mr. Vinson in the House. It developed into an especially close
                                                        relationship after the death of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945.

                                                        When the President went to Key West in the winter the Chief Justice would accompany him or visit him. The Vinson family would go to the White House for Thanksgiving dinner with the Trumans. Both the President and the Chief Justice had telephones by their
                                                        beds, and regularly held long talks at night, in which the President received Mr. Vinson&apos;s advice and counsel on many problems. Throughout the Truman Administration Mr. Vinson was regarded as
                                                        one of the real inner circle at the White House, one of the &quot;top ten.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Vinson&apos;s name was frequently mentioned as a possible Democratic candidate for President in 1948 and 1952 if Mr. Truman did not choose to run. The Chief Justice was generally regarded in Washington as the President&apos;s choice to succeed him
                                                        in 1952 if Mr. Truman himself did not run, but Mr. Vinson let it be known he had no Presidential ambitions, and early in 1952 it was reported he had indicated to the President he preferred not to
                                                        be a candidate.

                                                        At one time, when Secretary of State Dean Acheson was under fire and reports of his resignation were current, Mr. Vinson was mentioned in Washington as his possible successor.

                                                        Mr. Vinson regarded himself as &quot;a little left of center&quot; in politics. He was considered a moderate New Dealer, and supported most of President Roosevelt&apos;s policies, but maintained a stubborn independence and opposed any projects which he
                                                        thought passed beyond the line of true liberalism into &quot;totalitarian&quot; liberalism. Political Washington marked him down as both &quot;anti-Socialist and anti-reactionary.&quot; In the Supreme
                                                        Court he became one of the middle-of-the-road &quot;liberal-conservative&quot; group that sought to reconcile national security with individual rights and maintain a balance to preserve and strengthen

A friend of his once said: &quot;He looks like an extremely dignified sheep with a hangover, but
                                                        he is not at all like a sheep and he never has a hangover.&quot;

                                                        He was genial, affable and kindly, hearty and sincere, amiable and unaffected, a convivial companion who occasionally took a drink but not often, a dignified man of grave demeanor, calm judgment, a great amount of patience, and an easy manner.

                                                        know-how that won him such wide friendships in all branches of governmental Washington.

At the time the Supreme Court was split into two warring groups, and beset with personal as well as
                                                        legal animosities. One was headed by Associate Justice Hugo Black, a former Senator from Alabama, the other by Associate Justice Robert G. Jackson of New York, a former Attorney General of the United
                                                        States. Both were appointees of President Roosevelt.

                                                        The feuding between the two groups, which had been going on in private before Justice Stone&apos;s death, with occasional hints finding their way into print, flared into the open immediately after Justice Vinson&apos;s appointment. President Truman and
                                                        others in high places in Washington had been familiar with the situation before, and there is reason to believe that Mr. Vinson was named to the court primarily to bring peace and restore some of
                                                        the court&apos;s prestige with the bar and public.

The vacancy had been caused
                                                        by President Roosevelt&apos;s ouster of Jesse Jones as Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan Administrator to make a place in the Cabinet for Henry A. Wallace, whom the Democrats had refused to

He had no more than restored morale and got the agency working smoothly again after the repercussions of the Jones- Wallace contest than he was drafted to replace Mr. Byrnes as director of
                                                        War Mobilization and Reconversion where his main task was to chart a course that would enable the country to make the transition from war to peace without undue disruption of the economic system.

                                                        His major contribution as Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion was the issuance of several reports pointing out the road the country must follow which won widespread acclaim. The purposes of the reports were to dissipate uncertainties about Government
                                                        policies in the transition period and enable business and labor to plan intelligently their future relations. It was the general view at the time that he succeeded magnificently in the assignment.

Instead, President Truman, who had succeeded to the White House on President Roosevelt&apos;s death, called upon him
                                                        to head the Treasury Department. Henry Morgenthau Jr. never had enjoyed cordial relations with Congress, and, with tax legislation again a subject of major discussion, the new President decided the
                                                        Treasury Department needed as its head a man in the good graces of Congress and conversant with tax sentiment and problems.

As Secretary, he brought about the first reduction in tax rates in fourteen years, recommending a bill, which Congress
                                                        accepted, removing almost 12,000,000 persons from the tax rolls through increased exemptions.

                                                        were to be welcomed, not deplored. They conclusively proved that the United States was a democracy, he explained, adding that regular unanimity among judges is possible only in Fascist and Communist

                                                        the reduction of bail. He wrote that the United States in fighting communism must not accept Communist methods, and added that Communists, like everyone else, were entitled to reasonable bail unless
                                                        the Government could prove evidence justifying exceptional bail.
