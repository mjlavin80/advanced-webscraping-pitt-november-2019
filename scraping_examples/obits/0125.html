                                                    <p>LONDON, April 2--Mrs. Virginia Woolf, novelist and essayist, who has been missing from her home since last Friday, is believed to have been drowned at Rodwell, near Lewes, where she and her husband,
                                                        Leonard Sidney Woolf, had a country residence.</p>

                                                        Mr. Woolf said tonight:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Mrs. Woolf is presumed to be dead. She went for a walk last Friday, leaving a letter behind, and it is thought she has been drowned. Her body, however, has not been recovered.&quot;

                                                    </p>

                                                        Mrs. Virginia Woolf was a granddaughter of Thackeray and a relative of the Darwins, Symondses and Stracheys. She grew up in a household that Stevenson, Ruskin, Lowell, Hardy, Meredith and other writers visited. As the wife of Leonard Woolf and the sister-in-law
                                                        of Clive Bell, Mrs. Woolf had a literary circle of her own.

                                                        Of one of her novels, &quot;The Years,&quot; Ralph Thompson, book reviewer of The New York Times, said: &quot;Mrs. Woolf is nearest perfection when dealing with the past or with a present that has already begun to lose itself in the past. Then she is
                                                        near perfection indeed.&quot;

                                                        When not working on novels and longer essays, Mrs. Woolf frequently wrote critical articles for literary magazines, entering a number of literary controversies. One of her last tilts was with book reviewers in December, 1939.

                                                        She contended it was a &quot;public duty&quot; to abolish the book reviewer, holding that reviews were so hurriedly written that the reviewer was unable to deal adequately with the books his editor sent him. Mrs. Woolf declared no Act of Parliament would
                                                        be necessary to abolish the reviewer, contending that the tendencies she deplored would soon condition him out of existence.

                                                    <p>LONDON, April 2--Mrs. Virginia Woolf, novelist and essayist, who has been missing from her home since last Friday, is believed to have been drowned at Rodwell, near Lewes, where she and her husband,
                                                        Leonard Sidney Woolf, had a country residence.</p>

                                                        Mrs. Virginia Woolf was a granddaughter of Thackeray and a relative of the Darwins, Symondses and Stracheys. She grew up in a household that Stevenson, Ruskin, Lowell, Hardy, Meredith and other writers visited. As the wife of Leonard Woolf and the sister-in-law
                                                        of Clive Bell, Mrs. Woolf had a literary circle of her own.

                                                        She was the author of fifteen books of high quality, in which the critics met up with at least four different kinds of thinking and writing. This led to her being characterized as &quot;the multiple Mrs. Woolf.&quot;

                                                        when before has an educated man asked a woman how in her opinion war can be prevented.&quot;

                                                        Of one of her novels, &quot;The Years,&quot; Ralph Thompson, book reviewer of The New York Times, said: &quot;Mrs. Woolf is nearest perfection when dealing with the past or with a present that has already begun to lose itself in the past. Then she is
                                                        near perfection indeed.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        When not working on novels and longer essays, Mrs. Woolf frequently wrote critical articles for literary magazines, entering a number of literary controversies. One of her last tilts was with book reviewers in December, 1939.

                                                    <p>
                                                        She contended it was a &quot;public duty&quot; to abolish the book reviewer, holding that reviews were so hurriedly written that the reviewer was unable to deal adequately with the books his editor sent him. Mrs. Woolf declared no Act of Parliament would
                                                        be necessary to abolish the reviewer, contending that the tendencies she deplored would soon condition him out of existence.

Her favorite recreation was printing, in which she joined with her husband, Leonard Woolf, novelist and essayist, founder of the Hogarth Press and former literary editor of The Nation.
