                                                    <h5>By LEE A. DANIELS</h5>
                                                    <p>James Baldwin, whose passionate, intensely personal essays in the 1950&apos;s and 60&apos;s on racial discrimination in America made him an eloquent voice of the civil-rights movement, died of stomach
                                                        cancer early yesterday at his home in St. Paul de Vence in southern France. He was 63 years old. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At least in the early years of his career, Mr. Baldwin saw himself primarily as a novelist. But it is his essays that arguably constitute his most substantial contribution to literature.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Baldwin published his three most important collections of essays -&apos;&apos;Notes of a Native Son&apos;&apos; (1955), &apos;&apos;Nobody Knows My Name&apos;&apos; (1961) and &apos;&apos;The Fire Next Time&apos;&apos; (1963) - during the years when
                                                        the civil-rights movement was exploding across the American South. </p>
                                                    <b>Apocalyptic Tone in Prose </b>
                                                    <p> Some critics later said his language was sometimes too elliptical, his indictments sometimes too sweeping. But then, Mr. Baldwin&apos;s prose, with its apocalyptic tone - a legacy of his early exposure

                                                        &apos;&apos;I would place him very high among writers,&apos;&apos; Benjamin DeMott, professor of English at Amherst College, said yesterday, &apos;&apos;in part because his work showed a powerful commitment to the right values and had a profound impact
                                                        for good on our culture.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> Mr. Baldwin had moved to France in the late 1940&apos;s to escape what he felt was the stifling racial bigotry of America. </p>
                                                    <p> Nonetheless, although France remained his permanent residence, Mr. Baldwin in later years described himself as a &apos;&apos;commuter&apos;&apos; rather than an expatriate. </p>

                                                        and I could see that I carried myself, which is my home, with me. You can never escape that. I am the grandson of a slave, and I am a writer. I must deal with both.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Henry Louis Gates, professor of English and Afro-American Literature at Cornell University, said yesterday that Mr. Baldwin&apos;s death was &apos;&apos;a great loss not only for black people, but to
                                                        the country as a whole, for which he served as a conscience.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Gates said that Mr. Baldwin had &apos;&apos;educated an entire generation of Americans about the civil-rights struggle and the sensibility of Afro-Americans as we faced and conquered the final barriers
                                                        in our long quest for civil rights.&apos;&apos; </p>

                                                    <p> Despite the prominent role he played in the civil-rights movement in the early 1960&apos;s - not only in writing about race relations, but in organizing various protest actions - Mr. Baldwin always rejected
                                                        the labels of &apos;&apos;leader&apos;&apos; or &apos;&apos;spokesman.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Instead, he described himself as one whose mission was to &apos;&apos;bear witness to the truth.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;A spokesman assumes that he is speaking for others,&apos;&apos; he told Julius Lester, a faculty colleague at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, in an interview in The New York Times
                                                        Book Review in 1984. &apos;&apos;I never assumed that I could. What I tried to do, or to interpret and make clear, was that no society can smash the social contract and be exempt from the consequences,
                                                        and the consequences are chaos for everybody in the society.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This serene sense of independence was not simply a political stance, but an intrinsic part of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s personality.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;I was a maverick, a maverick in the sense that I depended on neither the white world nor the black world,&apos;&apos; he told Mr. Lester. &apos;&apos;That was the only way I could&apos;ve
                                                        played it. I would&apos;ve been broken otherwise. I had to say, &apos;A curse on both your houses.&apos; The fact that I went to Europe so early is probably what saved me. It gave me another touchstone
                                                        - myself.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Baldwin did not limit his &apos;&apos;bearing witness&apos;&apos; to racial matters. He opposed American military involvement in Vietnam as early as 1963, and in the early 1960&apos;s he began to
                                                        criticize discrimination against homosexuals. </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Baldwin&apos;s literary achievements and his activism made him a world figure and to the end of his life brought him many honors in this country and abroad. The French Government made him a Commander
                                                        of the Legion of Honor in 1986. </p>

                                                        Yet Mr. Baldwin was also clearly disappointed that, despite his undeniable powers as an essayist, his novels and plays drew decidely mixed reviews.
                                                    </p>

                                                        the book tells of a poor boy growing up in Harlem in the 1930&apos;s under the tyranny of his father, an autocratic preacher who hated his son. </p>

                                                        Mr. Baldwin said in 1985 that in many ways the book remained the keystone of his career.

                                                        with my father. He was my model. I learned a lot from him. Nobody&apos;s ever frightened me since.&apos;&apos; </p>

                                                        But the reception accorded his other works was at best lukewarm, and his frank discussion of homosexuality in &apos;&apos;Giovanni&apos;s Room&apos;&apos; (1956) and &apos;&apos;Another Country&apos;&apos; (1962) drew criticism from within and outside
                                                        the civil-rights movement.

                                                        In a celebrated polemic in the late 1960&apos;s, Eldridge Cleaver, then a member of the Black Panther Party, asserted that the novel illustrated Mr. Baldwin&apos;s &apos;&apos;agonizing, total hatred of blacks.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Another assessment of Mr. Baldwin was offered by the poet Langston Hughes, who observed, &apos;&apos;Few American writers handle words more effectively in the essay form than James Baldwin. To my way
                                                        of thinking, he is much better at provoking thought in the essay than he is in arousing emotion in fiction.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Baldwin&apos;s other works included the novel &apos;&apos;Tell Me How Long the Train&apos;s Been Gone,&apos;&apos; the stage plays &apos;&apos;Blues For Mister Charlie,&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;The
                                                        Amen Corner,&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;The Evidence of Things Not Seen,&apos;&apos; a long essay on the murder of 28 black children in Atlanta in 1980 and 1981. </p>
                                                    <p> Characteristically, Mr. Baldwin did not shrink from acknowledging the lesser view of his works of fiction, nor that his fame had slipped since the early 1970&apos;s. </p>
                                                    <p>

                                                    <p> James Baldwin was born in 1924 in Harlem and attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He was a precocious writer, and by his early 20&apos;s was publishing reviews and essays in such publications
                                                        as The New Leader, The Nation, Commentary and Partisan Review, and socializing with the circle of New York writers and intellectuals that included Randall Jarrell, Dwight Macdonald, Lionel Trilling,
                                                        Delmore Schwartz, Irving Howe and William Barrett, among others. </p>
                                                    <p> Yet, Mr. Baldwin was among the last one would have initially marked for a leadership role in a national movement. Soft-spoken, with a manner of speaking that mirrored his complex writing style, and physically
                                                        slight, he thought of himself for many years as ugly, and wrote poignantly of his struggle to accept the way he looked. </p>
                                                    <p> He is survived by his mother, Berdis Baldwin; five sisters, Paula Whaley, Gloria Smart and Barbara Jamison, all of New York City, Ruth Crum of Ossining, N.Y., and Elizabeth Dingle of Alexandria, Va.,

Americans to accept the black man as one of themselves, for to do so was to jeopardize their status as
white men. But not so to accept him was to deny his human reality, his human weight and complexity, and
