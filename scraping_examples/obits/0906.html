                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At Hull House, in the squalid slums of Chicago&apos;s West Side, Jane Addams, a priestess of understanding among neighbors and of peace among nations, kept open hours for prince and pauper alike. It was her shrine and it will remain her monument.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This pioneer settlement house, which she founded forty-six years ago, blazed the trail for a scientific approach to the relief of poverty and suffering and was the parent of much of the social legislation of the last four decades.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Its founder and director, despite poor health, was the inspiration and fighting force behind a score of movements for reform and the betterment of mankind. Of all the causes she espoused, the dearest to her heart was the cause of disarmament and peace.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For her life-long devotion to this ideal, she, with Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University, received the Nobel Peace Prize, her share of which she characteristically turned over to further the cause of peace.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Miss Addams has been called &quot;the greatest woman in the world,&quot; the &quot;mother of social service,&quot; &quot;the greatest woman internationalist&quot; and the &quot;first citizen of Chicago.&quot; With her idealism, serene, unafraid, militant,
                                                        was always paramount. Devoted to the cause of social and political reform, to the betterment of the economic condition of the masses, to world peace and to internationalism, Miss Addams&apos;s influence
                                                        was world-wide. She was, perhaps, the world&apos;s best-known and best-loved woman.

Socialists and other radicals met at Hull House, and her opponents sometimes forgot that her liberal attitude in permitting such meetings did not include a membership in the groups

But she did not ignore other causes. Lavishly she gave of herself to fight child labor, to lead political causes such as those of Colonel

                                                        Miss Addams was born in Cedarville, Ill., on Sept. 6, 1860, of Quaker ancestry. Had she chosen it, this woman who gave herself so unselfishly to the cause of the poor, the ignorant and the oppressed, could have enjoyed wealth and social position.

                                                        Her father, John H. Addams, a friend of Abraham Lincoln, was a banker who served from 1854 to 1870 in the Illinois Senate. Lincoln&apos;s creed of the equality of men became Miss Addams&apos;s ideal as a child.

                                                        In one of her books Miss Addams wrote:

                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;My father always spoke of the martyred President as Mr. Lincoln, and I never heard the great name without a thrill.

                                                        desk a thin packet marked &apos;Mr. Lincoln&apos;s Letters,&apos; the shortest one of which bore unmistakable traces of that remarkable personality. These letters began &apos;My Dear Double D-&apos;ed
                                                        Addams,&apos; and to the inquiry as to how the person thus addressed was about to vote on a certain measure then before the Legislature was added the assurance that he knew this Addams &apos;would
                                                        vote according to his conscience.&apos;&quot;

                                                        She wrote also that the first exciting suggestion &quot;of the great world of moral enterprise and serious undertakings&quot; came when she was 12 and she found her father mourning over the death of Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian patriot. Her father explained
                                                        how Mazzini had striven all his life for the freedom of his country.

                                                        between groups for men who are trying to abolish slavery in America or to throw off Hapsburg oppression in Italy.&quot;

She said she was pigeon-toed and twisted in the back so that her head leaned slightly to one side and she didn&apos;t want to have any one know she was the daughter of so fine a man as her father.
                                                        But surgery cured her deformities and she became a young woman described as &quot;beautiful, not pretty,&quot; &quot;beautiful because of her remarkable expression.&quot; She became, too, graceful,
                                                        erect, with a fine carriage.

It was not the Alps, the art galleries or the cathedrals that impressed her, but rather the slums of the great cities. More than ever she was determined
                                                        to dedicate her life to the service of the poor.

She was greatly impressed as she was by the European slums she visited. Returning to the United States, she was ill for some months and then, in 1888, she studied
                                                        for a time in Philadelphia.

Four years previously the stately red brick
                                                        mansion had been built by Charles J. Hull on the outskirts of the city. By 1889, however, it stood in the heart of one of the most miserable neighborhoods of the city. The owner, Miss Helen Culver,
                                                        gave the two women a free leasehold to the house and later to the land about it, on which twelve additional buildings were built.

                                                        After the conference Miss Addams toured Europe in an effort to persuade the heads of the belligerent nations to make peace. But she found that the war spirit was dominant. The movement for a conference to offer continuous mediation, which she backed,
                                                        was checked by the refusal of President Wilson to move in the matter.

                                                        Henry Ford then offered to convey several hundred Americans to Europe on a peace mission. Miss Addams intended to sail, but could not, as she was desperately ill in Chicago at the time the Oscar II sailed. The Lusitania had been sunk by this time and
                                                        American patriotism became so vehement as to cause resentment against Miss Addams.

                                                    <p>
                                                        She was horrified at the sinking, but said that &quot;talk of reprisal and aggression can only increase the spirit of bitterness.&quot; She opposed going to war over the case and continued to cooperate with those who wanted to stop the war.

                                                        After the war declaration in April, 1917, she met measures for strengthening of the blockade of the Central Powers with the declaration that the United States &quot;should not allow the women and children of any nation to starve.&quot; She declared later
                                                        that &quot;the feelings of German-born Americans should have been considered before the United States entered the war.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        She was never accused of being pro-German, but was much criticized for her pacifism. After the war she presided at international conferences of the league in Zurich in 1919, in Vienna in 1921, in The Hague in 1922, in Washington in 1924, in Dublin in
                                                        1926 and at Prague in 1929. Always in her peace work she was forward looking. It was noted that in the resolutions adopted at the first conference in 1915 many of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen
                                                        Points were forecast. In 1924 much opposition was manifested in this country to the conference, to which Miss Addams replied gracefully, without rancor.

                                                    <p>
                                                        In politics she was always liberal. She seconded the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 for the Presidency by the Progressive party and in 1924 was a member of the Committee of 100 which supported La Follette and his party. In 1916 she cast her
                                                        first vote for Wilson, regretting that she was too ill to campaign for him, as she had for Roosevelt four years before.</p>

The social justice planks of the party that year appealed strongly to her. Then, as at all other times, she kept on fighting for the causes she stood for. She supported
                                                        Hoover in 1928.

She viewed with equanimity the shortening of women&apos;s dress in 1921 and held that there was
                                                        no objection to cigarette smoking by women. She declared that it was &quot;all nonsense about women degenerating&quot; and that they were merely following the fashion. In 1922 she said that girls,
                                                        in her opinion, were growing morally better.

In 1920 she said that a &quot;modification of
                                                        our ideal of private property is at hand,&quot; adding that &quot;nothing is more certain than the imminence of social change.&quot;

In

She never fully recovered her strength and on the very day of the announcement that she and Dr. Butler had won the Nobel Prize she entered Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for
