                                                    <h5>By THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Joseph Stalin became the most important figure in the political direction of one-third of the people of the world. He was one of a group of hard revolutionaries that established the first important Marxist state and, as its dictator, he carried forward
                                                        its socialization and industrialization with vigor and ruthlessness.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        During the second World War, Stalin personally led his country&apos;s vast armed forces to victory. When Germany was defeated, he pushed his country&apos;s frontiers to their greatest extent and fostered the creation of a buffer belt of Marxist-oriented
                                                        satellite states from Korea across Eurasia to the Baltic Sea. Probably no other man ever exercised so much influence over so wide a region.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In the late Nineteen Forties, when an alarmed world, predominantly non-Communist, saw no end to the rapid advance of the Soviet Union and her satellites, there was a hasty and frightened grouping of forces to form a battle line against the Marxist advance.
                                                        Stalin stood on the Elbe in Europe and on the Yalu in Asia. Opposed to him stood the United States, keystone in the arch of non-Marxist states.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Stalin took and kept the power in his country through a mixture of character, guile and good luck. He outlasted his country&apos;s intellectuals, if indeed, he did not contrive to have them shot, and he wore down the theoreticians and dreamers. He could
                                                        exercise great charm when he wanted to. President Harry Truman once said in an unguarded moment:

                                                        But the Stalin that the world knew best was hard, mysterious, aloof and rude. He had a large element of the Oriental in him; he was once called &quot;Ghengis Khan with a telephone&quot; and he spent much of his life nurturing the conspiracies that brought
                                                        him to power and kept him there.

Opinion of Leon Trotsky

                                                        Leon Trotsky, Stalin&apos;s brilliant and defeated adversary, regarded him as an intellectual nonentity who personified &quot;the spirit of mediocrity&quot; that impregnated the Soviet bureaucracy. Lenin, who valued Stalin highly as a party stalwart,
                                                        characterized him as &quot;crude&quot; and &quot;rough&quot; and as a &quot;cook who will prepare only peppery dishes.&quot;

And,
                                                        indeed, only a man of iron will and determination like Stalin&apos;s could have held together his shattered country during that period of the war when German armies had overrun huge portions of Russian
                                                        territory and swept to the gates of Moscow, Leningrad and the Caucasus. Like Churchill in England, Stalin never faltered, not even at moments when everything seemed lost.

                                                        the frontyard of the capital. His battle orders and exhortations to the Russian armies and people to persevere in the fight contributed immensely to final victory. Repeatedly, Churchill referred

War Role Paramount

Surrounded by a galaxy of brilliant generals, whose names will go down in history as among the greatest of Russia&apos;s military
                                                        leaders, Stalin was portrayed in the Soviet and foreign press as the supreme commander responsible for over-all strategy. To what extent this was true will have to be determined by the future historian,
                                                        but that his role in the conduct of the war was paramount is undeniable.

Long before he dreamed
                                                        of becoming the supreme autocrat of Russia he had displayed the steel in his character as a political prisoner under the Czarist regime. A fellow prisoner of that period gave an illustration of Stalin&apos;s

                                                        shower blows upon them with rifle butts. With head high, a book under his arm, Stalin walked the gantlet without a whimper, his face and head bleeding, his eyes flashing defiance. It was the kind

Attended a Seminary

                                                        When he was 6 or 7, young Stalin contracted smallpox, which left him pock-marked for life. Through the efforts of his mother, who worked as a part-time laundress, Stalin entered a church school at 9. He was remembered there as a bright, self-assertive
                                                        boy who loved argument and who flew into a fury with those who did not agree with him. He remained in this school from 1888 to 1893.

The seminary was a gloomy institution--a cross between a barracks and a monastery--where
                                                        the students attended endless lectures on theology and spent their few spare moments plotting to obtain forbidden books from the outside.</p>

                                                        Stalin was among the worst offenders. An entry against him in the seminary&apos;s book of discipline has been preserved:

This is the thirteenth time this student has been discovered reading
                                                        books borrowed from the Cheap Library. &quot;

His revolutionary apprenticeship
                                                        was served as an organizer of the Tiflis transportation workers. He helped stage street demonstrations and distribute revolutionary leaflets.

The demonstration was drowned in blood by Cossacks, and he went into hiding for a year to escape the police. At this time he assumed
                                                        the nickname of &quot;Koba,&quot; after a hero in Georgian mythology.

A few weeks later he was deputized to go to Batum, a thriving industrial and commercial center, to direct revolutionary
                                                        activity. In March of that year he led a strike of oil workers in that city.

While in prison he learned of the meeting in London, in 1903, of the second congress of the Russian Social Democratic party, at which the party split
                                                        into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks-- extremists and moderates--an event that subsequently determined the entire course of the Russian Revolution. Stalin allied himself with Nikolai Lenin, leader of the
                                                        Bolsheviks. Trotsky was against Lenin, although in 1917, after the revolution, he joined Lenin and became his principal lieutenant in the October Revolution and in the establishment of the Soviet

There he received his first letter from Lenin in response
                                                        to one posing certain questions concerning Bolshevist policy and tactics. The letter confirmed him in his adherence to Lenin, whom he glorified as &quot;Mountain Eagle.&quot; Determined to escape,
                                                        Stalin made his way safely to Irkutsk at the end of the year. From there he proceeded to Baku, in the Caucasus, where he experienced his second baptism of fire as leader of a strike of oil workers.
                                                        It was part of a wave of strikes that swept Russia with her defeat by Japan, a wave that was the harbinger of the Revolution of 1905.</p>

                                                        Shortly after the outbreak of the general strike which was the key element in the revolution of 1905, Stalin met Lenin for the first time at a party conference in Tammerfors, Finland.

There had been other
                                                        such &quot;expropriations,&quot; but this was the biggest and most dramatic. Formally, Lenin and his associates had frowned upon these acts, but they, nevertheless, accepted the proceeds to help
                                                        finance the party&apos;s work. In the Erivan Square affair a band of revolutionists directed by &quot;Koba&quot; fell upon a convoy of two carriages carrying Government funds from the railway station
                                                        to the state bank, and after bombing the Cossack guard escaped with the money, which was sent to Lenin.

Soon thereafter he was exiled for the second time to Solvychegodsk, in Siberia,
                                                        from which he escaped on June 24, 1909. He returned to Baku to resume his revolutionary activity, but remained at liberty only eight months, when he was again arrested and sent back to Solvychegodsk.
                                                        From that place he conducted secret correspondence with Lenin and his staff at Bolshevik headquarters in Cracow.

                                                        Eager to attend a party conference in Prague, Stalin again escaped and made his way to St. Petersburg, where he was arrested and exiled to Vologda. Once more he escaped and reached St. Petersburg on the day of the notorious massacre of workers in the
                                                        Lena goldfields in Siberia. In St. Petersburg he helped found Pravda, the official organ of the Bolshevik party, but on the day of its first issue he was arrested and exiled to Narym, in the Urals.
                                                        On Sept. 1, 1912, he escaped and returned to St. Petersburg to resume the editorship of Pravda. This time he was betrayed by the agent provocateur Malinovsky, who had him arrested together with Jacob
                                                        Sverdlov, the future first President of the Soviet Union, at a concert given for the benefit of Pravda. Stalin and Sverdlov were exiled to Turuchansk, in Siberia, from which they were taken to the
                                                        outlying settlement of Kureika, 800 miles north of the Trans-Siberian Railway. After twenty years of revolutionary activity and repeated imprisonments and exilings. Stalin found himself at a dead

                                                        and world revolution.</p>

                                                        Stalin was transferred to Atchinsk, on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and it was there he first received word of the revolution of March 12, 1917. Almost the very first act of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, in which Alexander Kerensky was at first
                                                        Minister of Justice and later Premier, was to order the release of all political prisoners. Among the many thousands who profited by this decree signed by Kerensky was Joseph Stalin. He made his

                                                        On his arrival in Petrograd in March, 1917, Stalin went directly to the office of Pravda, where he was met by V. M. Molotov and Leo Kamenev. Lenin and most of his staff were in Zurich, Switzerland. It was not until April 16, 1917, that Lenin arrived in
                                                        Petrograd after his famous journey through Germany in a sealed car provided by the German General Staff. The journey lead across Germany to Stockholm and through Finland. A month later Trotsky arrived
                                                        from America.

                                                        Upon his arrival in Petrograd in May, 1917, from the United States, where he had lived for several months, Trotsky lost no time in associating himself with Lenin in his demand for the overthrow of the Provisional Government, conclusion of an immediate
                                                        peace, a sweeping Socialist program and advocacy of world revolution. From the very beginning of this development Trotsky completely overshadowed Stalin and all others among Lenin&apos;s lieutenants.
                                                        He became Lenin&apos;s &quot;big stick.&quot;</p>

Nevertheless, that post in the hands of Stalin became symbolic and significant, for it was
                                                        under Stalin as supreme dictator that the Soviet Union, conceived as a multiple state of nationalities, achieved its greatest expansion, territorially and politically.</p>

Although his admirers picture him as taking the initiative with Lenin in planning and executing that historic upheaval against the opposition of Trotsky and others in Lenin&apos;s immediate

                                                        while others were either opposed or hesitant. Stalin supported Lenin. On that occasion, the minutes attest, Lenin, angry and defiant over the refusal of his collaborators to approve the plans for

                                                        in rebellion against the Kerensky regime. The Baltic Fleet played a leading role in the uprising. Later these same sailors, who had been gloried by Trotsky as &quot;the pride and beauty of the Russian
                                                        Revolution,&quot; were shot down en masse by Trotsky in their revolt against the Soviet regime in March, 1921.

This was particularly true during the fighting on the Tsaritsin and Perm fronts. Repeatedly Trotsky called him to order and on various occasions Lenin had to intervene
                                                        to make peace between them. The enmity and hatred between Trotsky and Stalin dated from that period.

This he ultimately achieved by utilizing his new position as general secretary of the party in building

                                                        After Lenin&apos;s death, authority was vested by the party in the hands of a triumvirate, consisting of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev. There were three principal factions in the party, the left, represented by Zinoviev; the right, headed by Rykov and
                                                        Bukharin, and the center, of which Stalin was regarded as the spokesman. Trotsky, who was ill a good part of the time, so much so that he had been unable to attend Lenin&apos;s funeral, had plans
                                                        of his own. He felt that ultimately, as Lenin&apos;s chief collaborator, he would inherit Lenin&apos;s mantle.

It was interpreted to maintain the dictatorship and to stabilize the revolution.

Despite this policy, with the advent of Hitler to power he joined in collective security measures. He abruptly abandoned his advocacy
                                                        of collective security in 1939, when he about-faced and signed a mutual nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany.

70th Birthday Celebrated

                                                        Pictures were published showing that Stalin&apos;s hair had whitened. Then on his seventieth birthday in 1949 his anniversary was celebrated in grand fashion.

He married twice. His first wife was Ekaterina Svanidze, who died after a long illness in 1907. They
                                                        had a son, Jacob, whose fate has been unknown since he became a German prisoner during World War II. In 1919 the Premier married Nadya Alliluyeva, the 17-year-old daughter of his old revolutionary
