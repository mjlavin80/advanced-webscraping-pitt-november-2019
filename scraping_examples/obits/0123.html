                                                        Sergei M. Eisenstein had been widely acclaimed as one of the world&apos;s foremost movie directors. He was responsible for such outstanding examples of the cinema art as &quot;Potemkin&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevsky,&quot; and he was said to have successfully
                                                        brought about in the motion picture a true fusion of all the arts.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        That many of his pictures were patently propaganda works was true, but to students of the movie art this appeared not so much to matter as the fact that he developed new techniques, devised camera approaches and sought always to bring out the potential
                                                        of a still developing form. That he forgot--or overlooked--to bring the Marxist message to one of his films two years ago brought him that fatal kiss of all--the accusation from the authoritative
                                                        Soviet magazine, Culture and Life, that his productions had been short on the prescribed Soviet requirement of art and interpretation of history.

He was only 26 when he directed &quot;Potemkin,&quot; which has been hailed as his greatest picture. It described the revolt
                                                        of the sailors on the armored ship Potemkin during the abortive revolt of 1905.

Developed Fusion of Arts</b>

                                                        Sergei M. Eisenstein had been widely acclaimed as one of the world&apos;s foremost movie directors. He was responsible for such outstanding examples of the cinema art as &quot;Potemkin&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevsky,&quot; and he was said to have successfully
                                                        brought about in the motion picture a true fusion of all the arts.

                                                        That many of his pictures were patently propaganda works was true, but to students of the movie art this appeared not so much to matter as the fact that he developed new techniques, devised camera approaches and sought always to bring out the potential
                                                        of a still developing form. That he forgot--or overlooked--to bring the Marxist message to one of his films two years ago brought him that fatal kiss of all--the accusation from the authoritative
                                                        Soviet magazine, Culture and Life, that his productions had been short on the prescribed Soviet requirement of art and interpretation of history.

                                                        One of his most striking contributions was the development of the montage and a new method of cutting and mounting film after &quot;shooting&quot; was over to produce a rapid panoramic progression of images that forcefully projected some idea. &quot;A
                                                        work of art understood dynamically is just the process of arranging images and feelings in the mind of the spectator,&quot; he wrote.

                                                        He once tried Hollywood. The visit was not a success and ended without his ever having been assigned a single picture. He did, however, go to Mexico, where he collaborated in the writing and directing of &quot;Thunder Over Mexico,&quot; which was released
