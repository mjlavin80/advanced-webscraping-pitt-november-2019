                                                    <p> Mrs. McAuliffe had looked forward to the mission with enthusiasm. &apos;&apos;I think just opening up the door, having this ordinary person fly, says a lot for the future,&apos;&apos; she said at a recent
                                                        news conference. &apos;&apos;You can always equate astronauts with explorers who were subsidized. Now you are getting someone going just to observe.&apos;&apos;

                                                        to. When I was young, women did not fly in space.&apos;&apos;</p> <b>Energetic and Goal-Oriented </b>

                                                        to Maryland, where she taught high school English and American history.

                                                        of life in orbit, and experienced weightlessness in a space agency training jet.
