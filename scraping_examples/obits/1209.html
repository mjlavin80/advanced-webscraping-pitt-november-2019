He was the Congressional leader who pushed hardest for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon and later, as Speaker, put his prestige on

But although he reached the heights
                                                        of political power and mingled easily with national and world leaders, Mr. O&apos;Neill was perhaps best known for his advice to colleagues to attend carefully to their constituents, because, as
                                                        he put it, &quot;All politics is local.&quot;

He was a rabid sports fan, frequently attending baseball games and boxing matches, a skilled poker player
                                                        and a devoted but struggling golfer.

                                                        down,&quot; he would insist. He opposed a balanced budget because, he said, it would &quot;dismantle the programs that I&apos;ve been working for as an old liberal.&quot;

He said the Democratic programs had created a broad middle class
                                                        whose members had forgotten the many benefits they had received from government -- in education and housing, for example -- and wanted to pull up the ladder behind them.

They produced a television commercial that featured an actor who resembled the Speaker laughing off warnings
                                                        that his car was low on fuel, until the vehicle finally ground to a halt. The announcer then proclaimed, &quot;The Democrats have run out of gas.&quot;

O&apos;Neill and Carter: Different Democrats

Mr. Carter, an emotionally taut Georgian with a scant power base among Democrats, had reached the White House
                                                        as an anti-politician, an outsider who publicly disdained Washington insiders personified by the gregarious Speaker, who had worked his way up from ward politics.

                                                        Mr. O&apos;Neill said he responded by referring to the 289 House Democrats in the majority. &quot;I said: &apos;Hey, wait a minute. You have 289 guys up there who know their districts pretty well. They ran against the Administration, and they wouldn&apos;t

Mr. O&apos;Neill said he had once told the President, &quot;Keep your left hand high.&quot; But the Speaker found that Mr. Carter was no boxing fan and was unfamiliar with the boxer&apos;s classic defensive
                                                        posture. &quot;He didn&apos;t know what I was talking about,&quot; Mr. O&apos;Neill said.

That
                                                        was when a Speaker could get binding commitments from committee chairmen; it was before the diffusion of power that Mr. O&apos;Neill himself worked to bring about. </p>

But the two men had a profound philosophical disagreement about government:
                                                        the Speaker regarded government as the solution to many social problems, as an agent of social change; Mr. Reagan regarded it as a problem in itself, interfering in the lives of Americans and impeding
                                                        economic and social progress.

Publicly, Mr. O&apos;Neill called Mr. Reagan &quot;Herbert Hoover with a

The speech was vintage O&apos;Neill.

But in exchange he had promised the American people &quot;the strongest code of ethics that this country has ever

                                                        of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Fund, for which he had been the chairman. </p>

                                                        in his chits. The result was a foregone conclusion. The vote was 344 to 79. </p>

                                                        that &quot;disciplinary measures&quot; were under consideration.

                                                        Thomas P. O&apos;Neill Jr. was born on Dec. 9, 1912, in a working-class area of Cambridge, Mass., which later became part of his Congressional district. His father was a member of the Cambridge City Council. His mother died when he was a child, and his
                                                        father remarried.

                                                        He picked up the nickname Tip from a baseball player, James Edward O&apos;Neill of the old St. Louis Browns, who had the knack of hitting foul tips until the pitcher walked him. So Mr. O&apos;Neill&apos;s boyhood friends gave him the name. The Speaker
                                                        was an inveterate fan of the Boston Red Sox.

                                                        Educated in Roman Catholic schools, he broke into politics at 15, campaigning for Al Smith in his 1928 Presidential campaign against Herbert C. Hoover. &quot;All I knew was that Al Smith was an Irish Catholic and we had been suppressed all our lives,&quot;
                                                        he said.

                                                        Four years later, he helped get out the vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt. &quot;You&apos;d have Mrs. Murphy ready to get into an automobile to take her to the polls,&quot; he recalled. &quot;And then you&apos;d go to the next house, Mrs. Sweeney, and you&apos;d
                                                        have the car come for Mrs. Sweeney. We walked the streets to get the votes out.&quot;

But he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1936, where he rose to Speaker, and where he remained until 1952,
                                                        when he was elected to the United States House.

Curley, the Boston politician whose career was the basis of the Edwin O&apos;Connor novel &quot;The Last Hurrah.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Until then, Mr. O&apos;Neill roomed with Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachusetts, his closest friend. Their refrigerator was said to be stocked almost exclusively with beer.

McCormack of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip who went on to become House Speaker in 1962. Mr. McCormack introduced him to the House power structure as part of the informal &quot;board
                                                        of education&quot; meetings that Speaker Rayburn held after hours for Congressional leaders and friends. By his second term in the House, Mr. O&apos;Neill had won a coveted seat on the Rules Committee.

                                                        Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his own district. His blue-collar constituents, who made up the bulk of his support, were overwhelmingly in favor of the American
                                                        role in the war. </p>

                                                        But Mr. O&apos;Neill wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Man of the House&quot; (Random House, 1987), that he had come to the conclusion that the conflict was a civil war and that American involvement in it was morally wrong. When President Lyndon B. Johnson
                                                        called him to the White House to explain his change of position, Mr. O&apos;Neill recalled, he told the President, &quot;In my heart and in my conscience I believe your policy is wrong.&quot; Johnson
                                                        accepted his position, Mr. O&apos;Neill said, when he found out that the Congressman had not changed it for political reasons.

                                                        But his opposition to the war did eventually reap some political dividends: he won the trust and support of younger House members who shared his position on Vietnam, and they became important allies as Mr. O&apos;Neill rose in power.

After Mr. Boggs died in a plane crash in Alaska in 1972, Mr. O&apos;Neill was elected majority leader.

He was instrumental in bringing changes that stripped the committee chairmen of their autocratic power, and he was the
                                                        Democratic leader who pushed hardest for the investigation and impeachment of President Nixon, who resigned before a vote on impeachment was held.

                                                        Mr. O&apos;Neill was elected Speaker by acclamation in December 1976, when he was 64, and took office the next month. &quot;The wonder of it is that such a decent, compassionate man could rise to the top of a place like this,&quot; said Representative
                                                        Benjamin S. Rosenthal, Democrat of Queens.

He was among many House members who accepted favors from Tongsun Park, the South Korean lobbyist and intelligence agent. In 1973 and &apos;74, Mr. O&apos;Neill permitted Mr. Park to sponsor two
                                                        lavish birthday parties in his honor, thereby bolstering Mr. Park&apos;s prestige.

                                                        Similarly, some questioned Mr. O&apos;Neill&apos;s judgment when he intervened in an application for Federal money made by James P. Wilmot, who had been chairman of the Democratic Party&apos;s Finance Committee.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Speaker telephoned the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carla A. Hills, in July 1975, asking when there would be a decision on Mr. Wilmot&apos;s request for $2.2 million in annual rent subsidies for a housing project. Such inquiries tend
                                                        to be viewed as requests for special consideration. In any event, Mr. Wilmot got his subsidies. </p>

Kennedy of Massachusetts and President Carter in 1980. He played a role behind the scenes at
                                                        the Democratic National Convention, however, negotiating an agreement that led to Mr. Kennedy&apos;s reluctant endorsement of the President.</p>

His book, &quot;Man of the House,&quot; however, written with William Novak, became a best seller that made him financially
