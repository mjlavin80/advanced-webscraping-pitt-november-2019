                                                        Pennsylvania conferred upon him at its bicentennial year commencement exercises the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As reflected in his publications, Dr. McClung&apos;s interests and activities covered a wide range of subject matter, but it was for his writings on the chromosomes and their relations to heredity and the classification and evolution of animals that he
                                                        was known around the world. He was the first to recognize the relations of chromosomes to the determination of sex, having discovered in 1902, through his study of the germ cells of grasshoppers,
                                                        that a difference existed in the chromosomal constitution of the two sexes.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1930 he represented the United States Government and various scientific organizations at the International Biological Congress at Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1933-34 the Rockefeller Foundation sent him as visiting professor at the Institute of Preventative
                                                        Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo.</p>

                                                        Dr. McClung leaves a widow, Mrs. Anna Drake McClung; two daughters, Mrs. Beth Bullis of Detroit and Mrs. Ruth Jones, a member of the faculty of Swarthmore College; three grandchildren and a sister, Mrs. W. R. Childs of Eldorado, Kan. </p>
                                                    <b>Explained Mendel&apos;s Law Basis</b>

                                                        Dr. McClung was known throughout the world for his extensive studies on chromosomes, the &quot;pods&quot; that carry the genes, units of heredity. He succeeded in explaining the mechanism underlying Mendel&apos;s Law, just as Mendel himself gave the first
                                                        acceptable explanation of inheritance as set forth in the Darwinian theory of evolution.</p>

                                                        He received from the University of Kansas a Ph. G. degree in 1892, and A. B. in 1896, an A. M. in 1898 and a Ph. D. in 1902. He took graduate work at Columbia and Chicago Universities and also held an honorary degree from Franklin and Marshall College.

                                                        attack yesterday in his home at near-by Swarthmore. His age was 75.

                                                    <p>Born in Clayton, Calif., Dr. McClung was graduated from the University of Kansas in 1892. He began his teaching career there in 1893, remaining until 1912, when he came to the University of Pennsylvania
                                                        as Professor of Zoology and director of the Zoological Laboratory.</p>
                                                    <p>Following his retirement from teaching in 1940, Dr. McClung spent one year at the University of Illinois as acting head of its Department of Zoology. At his death he was acting head of the Department
                                                        of Biology at Swarthmore College, substituting for Dr. Laurence Irving, who had entered military service.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Upon his completion of twenty-five years of teaching, approximately 100 of his former students joined in a testimonial to his &quot;profound influence on individuals and organizations concerned with biological research.&quot; In 1940 the University of
                                                        Pennsylvania conferred upon him at its bicentennial year commencement exercises the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As reflected in his publications, Dr. McClung&apos;s interests and activities covered a wide range of subject matter, but it was for his writings on the chromosomes and their relations to heredity and the classification and evolution of animals that he
                                                        was known around the world. He was the first to recognize the relations of chromosomes to the determination of sex, having discovered in 1902, through his study of the germ cells of grasshoppers,
                                                        that a difference existed in the chromosomal constitution of the two sexes.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1930 he represented the United States Government and various scientific organizations at the International Biological Congress at Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1933-34 the Rockefeller Foundation sent him as visiting professor at the Institute of Preventative
                                                        Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo.</p>

He succeeded in explaining the mechanism underlying Mendel&apos;s Law, just as Mendel himself gave the first
                                                        acceptable explanation of inheritance as set forth in the Darwinian theory of evolution.</p>
