                                                        Professor Buber&apos;s health had been failing since he underwent surgery for a broken leg last April. Since his release from the hospital last month he had been confined to bed at his home in the residential quarter of Talbeih.

                                                        One of the great thinkers of this century, Dr. Buber had served as a professor at the Hebrew University since his arrival in Palestine in 1938 from his native Austria.

                                                        His translation of the Old Testament into German, begun with the late Franz Rosenzweig, is considered by many the best in existence.

                                                        Since 1951, when he retired from teaching, he had held the title of professor emeritus of social philosophy at the university. A few weeks ago he received the Freedom of Jerusalem Award, the last of many honors accorded him. Several years ago he was nominated

                                                        Martin Buber was a religious philosopher whose views on human and divine relationships had a fertilizing effect on the Christian world.

                                                    <p>
                                                        His philosophy of personalism was an amalgam of religious mysticism, Old Testament inspiration, modern psychology and earthy common sense. It contended that man could achieve an intimate relationship with God through an intimate interrelationship with
                                                        his fellow man, and that each man&apos;s relationship with God and a fellow man was distinct.

                                                    <p>
                                                        He strove for a &quot;a dialogue,&quot; between man and God with man as &quot;I&quot; and God as &quot;Thou.&quot; This concept was developed in his major philosophical work, &quot;I and Thou.&quot;

                                                        Professor Buber&apos;s views influenced Protestant theologians. He impressed Reinhold Niebuhr as &quot;the greatest living Jewish philosopher,&quot; and he was an inspiration in Dr. Niebuhr&apos;s thinking as well as in that of Paul Tillich, another leading
                                                        Protestant theologian.

                                                        By his emphasis on dialogue, Professor Buber was regarded as a pioneer bridge builder between Judaism and Christianity. His views accented the non-formal aspects of religion as opposed to theological systems.

Saw Religion as Experience</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Religion for Professor Buber was experience, not dogma. He doubted that man was made to conform with canon law, or with elaborately worked out plans for existence. On the contrary, Professor Buber&apos;s credo stressed individual responsibility.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A story that was told to illustrate this point concerned an aged pious man, Rabbi Susya, who became fearful as death drew near. His friends chided him, &quot;What! Are you afraid that you&apos;ll be reproached that you weren&apos;t Moses?&quot; &quot;No,&quot;
                                                        the rabbi replied, &quot;that I was not Susya.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        The responsibility to be oneself means, in Professor Buber&apos;s view, that there is no rigid fate; that man can improve his chances for happiness.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In fact, according to Professor Buber, man has an obligation to achieve an identity by refusing to abdicate his will before the monolithic power of party, corporation or state.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Professor Buber pointed to the duality of things--love and justice, freedom and order, good and evil: but he did not suggest a happy middle way between them.

                                                        rocky ridge between the gulfs, where there is only the certainty of meeting what remains undisclosed.&quot;

                                                        Professor Buber suggested two forms of relationships for man--an I-It relationship and an I- Thou. The first is impersonal and imperfect.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        An example of the I-It relationship would be where one person treats another as a machine, or when lovers find only a projection of themselves in each other.
                                                    </p>

                                                        In religious matters, the I-It is expressed when man abstracts God, or regards Him as out of reach, or builds theological systems in which God is remote, or considers God too vast. Professor Buber, however, did not deny that God was the great mystery
                                                        of the Old Testament, but he insisted that He was also personal.

There is in such a dialogue, he argued, a fusion of choosing and being chosen, of action
                                                        and reaction, that engages man&apos;s highest qualities.

                                                        This supreme confrontation has been described by Prof. Maurice S. Friedman of Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, N.Y., one of the leading interpreters of Buberism. It is &quot;perhaps best understood,&quot; Dr. Freidman wrote in his &quot;Martin Buber,
                                                        the Life of Dialogue,&quot; &quot;from the nature of the demand which one person makes on another if the two of them really meet. If you are to meet me, you must become as much of a person as I am.
                                                        In order to remain open to God [man] must change his whole being.&quot;

His social ideal was a small community unit somewhat like the kibbutzim of rural
                                                        Israel.

                                                        Professor Buber also looked at Scripture in a special way. The Bible, in his view, was neither an infallible guide to conduct nor a mere collection of legends, but a dialogue between Israel as Thou and God as I.

As for Reform Jews, some of them also criticized Professor Buber because they thought he had made
                                                        too much of the metaphysical Hasidic sect, from which he drew many of his ideas.

But he loved to have visitors and to talk endlessly. When a caller phoned he would hear a click and then a quick sharp one word response:
                                                        &quot;Buber.&quot;

                                                        When receiving visitors in his study, Dr. Buber would be without tie, in shirt sleeves and slippers behind his desk. He did not like general questions and frequently prompted his questioner with &quot;be specific.&quot;

                                                        He got angry with anyone who tried to ask him personal anecdotal questions, insisting that his personal life was just that.

                                                        In conversation he would rest his interlocked fingers on his paunch and then move them to his forehead as he considered his response. He weighted every word and when he finally answered it would be in a very slow low voice that seemed tinged with melancholy.

                                                        Professor Buber gave up lecturing at the Hebrew University in 1951, when he ended his active life as an educator. However it is recalled that some of his lectures on philosophy were reminiscent of the atmosphere that might have distinguished the Socratic
                                                        dialogues. On other occasions, while lecturing, he showed the zeal and earnestness, even veneration, with which Hasidic students are said to follow the words and teachings of their rabbi.

They swarmed into his garden and in the darkness illuminated by the flames he walked out onto his veranda,
                                                        his face wreathed in smiles, deeply appreciative of the gesture.

Born in Vienna in 1878</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Martin Buber was born in Vienna Feb. 8, 1878, of middle-class parents who were divorced when he was 3 years old. He spent much of his childhood in Lemberg, Galicia, [now Lvov, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic] with his grandfather Salomon Buber, a
                                                        well-known Hebrew scholar.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        While studying the Talmud with his grandfather, he also read poetry and novels and occasionally visited neighboring towns where he met Hasidic rabbis--holy men who could lead a community united by its love of God and its veneration for a wise man.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When he was 13 he began a drift away from formal Judaism. This was symbolized by his offering a bar mitzvah synagogue talk on Schiller, the dramatist, rather than on a scriptural subject. Later he gave up the daily prayer ritual, but not without misgivings
                                                        that almost led him to suicide because of what he said later was &quot;a mysterious and overwhelming compulsion&quot; to visualize the &quot;limiting brink of time--or its limitlessness.&quot;

                                                        He entered the University of Vienna at 17 and studied philosophy and the history of art there and at the Universities of Berlin, Zurich and Leipzig. He received a Ph. D. from Vienna in 1904, but he did not use the title.

Edited Zionist Journal</b></p>

                                                        In 1901 he came editor of Die Welt, the Zionist journal, and the following year he helped to found Judischer Verlag, a Jewish publishing house.

                                                        One of the writers for Die Welt was Paula Winkler, a brilliant, aristocratic Roman Catholic. She subsequently was married to Professor Buber, converting to Judaism, and remained at his side until her death in 1958. In her own right, Mrs. Buber was a novelist
                                                        under the name Georg Munk.

                                                        Meanwhile, there was a split in Zionism. Professor Buber was one of those who believed that a spiritual revival was more urgent than political nationhood. Mr. Herzl favored a political solution. In the course of the division, Professor Buber dropped out
                                                        of active Zionism and retired into solitude for five years.

Joy Impressed Him</b></p>

                                                        At the time, this grass-roots Judaism was considered as bordering on the occult, but Professor Buber found in Hasidism an experience of direct communion with the Divine. He was also impressed by the joy--the ecstatic dance and the wordless song--with
                                                        which they worshipped.

                                                        Returning from his retreat among the Hasidim, Professor Buber was active in Jewish journalism, editing from 1916 to 1924 Der Jude, a periodical of the German Jews. From 1926 to 1930, in concert with a Catholic and a Protestant, he edited the journal,
                                                        Die Kreatur.

When the Nazis excluded Jewish students from institutions of higher learning in 1933, Professor Buber helped to set up adult education classes
                                                        for them.

He spoke out, however, once lecturing on &quot;The Power of the Spirit&quot; in Berlin, although he knew that 200 SS (elite guard) men were in the audience. Utterly silenced in 1938, he went to Palestine,
                                                        where he was professor of social philosophy at the Hebrew University until his retirement in 1951.

A few weeks ago he received the Freedom of Jerusalem Award, the last of many honors accorded him. Several years ago he was nominated

Views Affected Christianity</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Martin Buber was a religious philosopher whose views on human and divine relationships had a fertilizing effect on the Christian world.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His philosophy of personalism was an amalgam of religious mysticism, Old Testament inspiration, modern psychology and earthy common sense. It contended that man could achieve an intimate relationship with God through an intimate interrelationship with
                                                        his fellow man, and that each man&apos;s relationship with God and a fellow man was distinct.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He strove for a &quot;a dialogue,&quot; between man and God with man as &quot;I&quot; and God as &quot;Thou.&quot; This concept was developed in his major philosophical work, &quot;I and Thou.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Professor Buber&apos;s views influenced Protestant theologians. He impressed Reinhold Niebuhr as &quot;the greatest living Jewish philosopher,&quot; and he was an inspiration in Dr. Niebuhr&apos;s thinking as well as in that of Paul Tillich, another leading
                                                        Protestant theologian.

                                                        By his emphasis on dialogue, Professor Buber was regarded as a pioneer bridge builder between Judaism and Christianity. His views accented the non-formal aspects of religion as opposed to theological systems.

Saw Religion as Experience</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Religion for Professor Buber was experience, not dogma. He doubted that man was made to conform with canon law, or with elaborately worked out plans for existence. On the contrary, Professor Buber&apos;s credo stressed individual responsibility.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A story that was told to illustrate this point concerned an aged pious man, Rabbi Susya, who became fearful as death drew near. His friends chided him, &quot;What! Are you afraid that you&apos;ll be reproached that you weren&apos;t Moses?&quot; &quot;No,&quot;
                                                        the rabbi replied, &quot;that I was not Susya.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The responsibility to be oneself means, in Professor Buber&apos;s view, that there is no rigid fate; that man can improve his chances for happiness.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In fact, according to Professor Buber, man has an obligation to achieve an identity by refusing to abdicate his will before the monolithic power of party, corporation or state.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Professor Buber pointed to the duality of things--love and justice, freedom and order, good and evil: but he did not suggest a happy middle way between them.

Contraries Held Inseparable</b></p>

                                                        &quot;I have occasionally described my standpoint to my friends as the &apos;narrow ridge.&apos; I wanted by this to express that I did not rest on the broad upland of a system that includes a series of sure statements about the absolute, but on a narrow,
                                                        rocky ridge between the gulfs, where there is only the certainty of meeting what remains undisclosed.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Professor Buber suggested two forms of relationships for man--an I-It relationship and an I- Thou. The first is impersonal and imperfect.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        An example of the I-It relationship would be where one person treats another as a machine, or when lovers find only a projection of themselves in each other.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In religious matters, the I-It is expressed when man abstracts God, or regards Him as out of reach, or builds theological systems in which God is remote, or considers God too vast. Professor Buber, however, did not deny that God was the great mystery
                                                        of the Old Testament, but he insisted that He was also personal.

There is in such a dialogue, he argued, a fusion of choosing and being chosen, of action
                                                        and reaction, that engages man&apos;s highest qualities.

Friedman of Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, N.Y., one of the leading interpreters of Buberism. It is &quot;perhaps best understood,&quot; Dr. Freidman wrote in his &quot;Martin Buber,
                                                        the Life of Dialogue,&quot; &quot;from the nature of the demand which one person makes on another if the two of them really meet. If you are to meet me, you must become as much of a person as I am.
                                                        In order to remain open to God [man] must change his whole being.&quot;

His social ideal was a small community unit somewhat like the kibbutzim of rural

                                                        Because of this interpretation and because Professor Buber was casual in his observance of Talmudic law, many Orthodox rabbis looked upon him as a heretic. As for Reform Jews, some of them also criticized Professor Buber because they thought he had made
                                                        too much of the metaphysical Hasidic sect, from which he drew many of his ideas.

                                                        Many Jews also were dismayed by the application that Professor Buber made of his beliefs in calling for an improvement of Arab-Israeli relations. This attitude rested on Professor Buber&apos;s assertion that &quot;the love of God is unreal unless it is
                                                        crowned with love for one&apos;s fellow men.&quot;

But he loved to have visitors and to talk endlessly. When a caller phoned he would hear a click and then a quick sharp one word response:

He weighted every word and when he finally answered it would be in a very slow low voice that seemed tinged with melancholy.

However it is recalled that some of his lectures on philosophy were reminiscent of the atmosphere that might have distinguished the Socratic
                                                        dialogues. On other occasions, while lecturing, he showed the zeal and earnestness, even veneration, with which Hasidic students are said to follow the words and teachings of their rabbi.

They swarmed into his garden and in the darkness illuminated by the flames he walked out onto his veranda,
                                                        his face wreathed in smiles, deeply appreciative of the gesture.

Born in Vienna in 1878</b></p>

                                                        Martin Buber was born in Vienna Feb. 8, 1878, of middle-class parents who were divorced when he was 3 years old. He spent much of his childhood in Lemberg, Galicia, [now Lvov, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic] with his grandfather Salomon Buber, a
                                                        well-known Hebrew scholar.

                                                    <p>
                                                        While studying the Talmud with his grandfather, he also read poetry and novels and occasionally visited neighboring towns where he met Hasidic rabbis--holy men who could lead a community united by its love of God and its veneration for a wise man.

                                                        When he was 13 he began a drift away from formal Judaism. This was symbolized by his offering a bar mitzvah synagogue talk on Schiller, the dramatist, rather than on a scriptural subject. Later he gave up the daily prayer ritual, but not without misgivings
                                                        that almost led him to suicide because of what he said later was &quot;a mysterious and overwhelming compulsion&quot; to visualize the &quot;limiting brink of time--or its limitlessness.&quot;

She subsequently was married to Professor Buber, converting to Judaism, and remained at his side until her death in 1958. In her own right, Mrs. Buber was a novelist

Professor Buber was one of those who believed that a spiritual revival was more urgent than political nationhood. Mr. Herzl favored a political solution. In the course of the division, Professor Buber dropped out
                                                        of active Zionism and retired into solitude for five years.

He was also impressed by the joy--the ecstatic dance and the wordless song--with
                                                        which they worshipped.

From 1926 to 1930, in concert with a Catholic and a Protestant, he edited the journal,
                                                        Die Kreatur.

When the Nazis excluded Jewish students from institutions of higher learning in 1933, Professor Buber helped to set up adult education classes
                                                        for them.

He spoke out, however, once lecturing on &quot;The Power of the Spirit&quot; in Berlin, although he knew that 200 SS (elite guard) men were in the audience. Utterly silenced in 1938, he went to Palestine,
                                                        where he was professor of social philosophy at the Hebrew University until his retirement in 1951.

                                                        Professor Buber was a prodigious writer. More than 700 books and papers by him are listed in one &quot;selected&quot; bibliography. Many of them deal with aspects of the I-Thou philosophy. He was also a translator of renown.

                                                        In Israel, Professor Buber was not a conformist. For example, he opposed the execution of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi put to death by Israel for crimes against the Jews.

                                                        Professor Buber visited the United States in 1951. The lectures he delivered here were later published as &quot;Eclipse of God&quot; and &quot;At the Turning.&quot; He received the Universal Brotherhood award from the Union Theological Seminary and an
                                                        honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.
