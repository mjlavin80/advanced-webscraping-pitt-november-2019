                                                        W. C. Handy, composer of the jazz classic &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; died before dawn yesterday at the age of 84. He had been in Sydenham Hospital in Harlem since Sunday with acute bronchial pneumonia.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Handy suffered a stroke three years ago. Since then he had been able to travel only in a wheelchair. With the exception of a few special occasions, he had been confined to his home at 19 Chester Drive, Yonkers.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At his bedside when Mr. Handy died were his wife, Mrs. Irma Louise Logan Handy, whom he married three years ago; two sons, William C. Handy Jr. and Wyer Handy; a daughter, Mrs. Katherine Lewis; a brother, Charles, and a grandson, William C. Handy 3d.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. and Mrs. Handy had planned to fly to St. Louis on April 7 for the opening of the Paramount film &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; a fictionalized biography of the composer, and featuring, of course, many of his blues songs. The film will open also in New
                                                        York and other major cities on the same date.</p>

                                                        Mr. Handy&apos;s last public appearance was on Nov. 17, 1957, at a birthday party for him in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. More than 800 actors, musicians and public personalities gathered in the Grand Ballroom to hail the &quot;father of the blues.&quot;

                                                        William Christopher Handy, son of emancipated slaves, rose from an Alabama log cabin to a Westchester mansion by capturing in song the melancholia of all loneliness and the sadness of his race.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Yet the composer of more than sixty other melodies, was outwardly cheerful, despite blindness during his later years.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Moon-faced and benign, with the deep chest of the trumpet player, the chunky composer was a bit of a philosopher. One day, in his eighties, he told school children how, in his youth, he had slept on cobblestones and Mississippi levees &quot;and heard
                                                        the roustabouts singing on the steamboats and it hung in my ears.&quot; He patted his trumpet and said:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Life is something like this trumpet. If you don&apos;t put anything in it you don&apos;t get anything out. And that&apos;s the truth.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        By then most of his friends were dead and, though the music for &quot;I hate to see that evenin&apos; sun go down&quot; was still in most jazz repertoires, his blues style, so popular for thirty years, seemed to have yielded to new jazz fads.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This did not disturb Mr. Handy&apos;s good cheer.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;The Negroes,&quot; he said, &quot;invented jazz, and the white folks made an industry out of it.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        In a sense politics started the &quot;blues&quot; in 1910. In that year Mr. Handy wrote a campaign song for Edward H. Crump that helped the &quot;Boss&quot; to become Mayor of Memphis. The song became more widely known than the Mayor after it was recorded
                                                        in 1917 as &quot;Memphis Blues,&quot; which described &quot;that melancholy strain, that ever-haunting strain is like a darky&apos;s sorrow song.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Handy was born on Nov. 16, 1873, in Florence Ala. His father and grandfather were Methodist preachers, pastors of the first Negro church in that community.

                                                        Describing his early childhood in his autobiography published in 1941 under the title &quot;Father of the Blues,&quot; Mr. Handy recalled that his upbringing was rather more strict than that of most of his white contemporaries.

                                                        &quot;With all the differences,&quot; he wrote, &quot;most of my forebears had one thing in common: if they had any musical talent, it remained buried. My mother admitted a fondness for the guitar, but she could not play it because the church put a taboo
                                                        on such instruments.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        When a small boy, Mr. Handy saved enough money to buy a guitar of his own, but his father ordered him to trade it for a dictionary.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At 15 he graduated into a minstrel show from his school singing class, only to return home when the traveling show ran out of money.

                                                        His second venture from home, with 20 cents in his pocket, had as its goal the World&apos;s Far in Chicago in 1893. The years following found him alternately employed, penniless, hungry and cold, and in St. Louis he reached his nadir.

But he must never quite have obliterated it all from his memory, for out of the experience grew &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; Written in 1914, it set the pattern for hundreds
                                                        of blues songs.

Before that he had eked out his musical education at the Negro Agricultural and Mechanical College near Huntsville, Ala. From this time on he was increasingly successful in organizing
                                                        orchestras and minstrels and in arranging the popular tunes of the day for minstrel performance.
