                                                        Cecil Blount De Mille was the Phineas T. Barnum of the movies--a showman extraordinary.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A pioneer in the industry, he used the broad medium of the screen to interpret in &quot;colossal&quot; and &quot;stupendous&quot; spectacles the story of the Bible, the splendor that was Egypt, the glory that was Rome. He dreamed in terms of millions,
                                                        marble pillars, golden bathtubs and mass drama; spent enormous sums to produce the rich effects for which he became famous.

                                                        During his lifetime, Mr. De Mille produced more than seventy major films, noted for their weight and mass rather than for subtlety or finely shaded artistry.

                                                        The fact that his first Oscar did not come until forty years after he had produced one of the earliest four-reel feature films, &quot;The Squaw Man,&quot; was brushed off with a characteristic De Millean gesture:
                                                    </p>

                                                        This was true. His pageants and colossals awed the urban, suburban and backwoods audiences. By 1946 his personal fortune, despite his regal spending habits, was estimated at $8,000,000.

He had been in radio about a decade by that
                                                        time, staging shows for a soap company at a reported salary of $5,000 a week.

His father, Henry Churchill De Mille, was of French-Dutch ancestry; his mother, the
                                                        former Matilda Beatrice Samuel, of English stock.

Mr. De Mille threw in his lot with the ambitious Lasky and with a newcomer in the theatre, Sam Goldwyn. All three reached the top run in the movie world, though finally along
                                                        separate paths.

                                                        The first product of the new movie company--The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company--was a screen version of &quot;The Squaw Man.&quot; It was turned out in an abandoned stable in Los Angeles with crude equipment, but it bore Mr. De Mille&apos;s mark.

                                                        He was credited with many motion picture innovations. Indoor lighting was first tried out on an actor in &quot;The Squaw Man.&quot; This picture, besides being the screen&apos;s first epic, was also the first to publicize the names of its stars.

This was
                                                        the nucleus around which he built his galaxy of screen stars.

He is also supposed to have conceived of opening films with a printed cast of characters. The so-called &quot;sneak
                                                        preview&quot;--showing a film to a test audience-- was another contribution.

From that time on Mr. De Mille wallowed in extravagant props and super-gorgeous sets. It was a good formula. It worked in &quot;The Crusades,&quot; &quot;The

He turned out flamboyant chunks of Americana in &quot;The Plainsman,&quot; taken from the lives of Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill; &quot;The Buccaneer,&quot;
                                                        a dramatic account of the life of the pirate Jean Lafitte; &quot;Union Pacific,&quot; and &quot;Reap the Wild Wind,&quot; a story about Key West.

Unlike the new &quot;The Ten Commandments,&quot; &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; was what the trade called a &quot;remake.&quot;

                                                        last fall.

In 1949 he produced &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; for about $3,000,000.
                                                        During that same year he was named chairman of the Motion Picture Industry Council.

He offered to pay the cost of erecting four bronze plaques at the base of &quot;Cleopatra&apos;s
