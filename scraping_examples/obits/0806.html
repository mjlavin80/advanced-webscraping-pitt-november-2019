                                                    <h5>By PETER B. FLINT</h5>
                                                    <p>Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She
                                                        was 77 years old. </p>
                                                    <p>A hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said the actress had suffered a rupture of the aorta after having improved steadily from a seven-hour operation.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Miss Ball, noted for impeccable timing, deft pantomime and an endearing talent for making the outrageous believable, was a Hollywood legend: a contract player at RKO in the 1930&apos;s and 40&apos;s
                                                        who later bought the studio with Desi Arnaz, her first husband.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>She made her last public appearance four weeks ago at the Academy Awards ceremonies, when she and Bob Hope introduced a production number. </p>
                                                    <p>The elastic-faced, husky-voiced comedian was a national institution from 1951 to 1974 in three series and many specials on television that centered on her &apos;&apos;Lucy&apos;&apos; character. The
                                                        first series, &apos;&apos;I Love Lucy,&apos;&apos; was for six years the most successful comedy series on television, never ranking lower than third. The series, on CBS, chronicled the life of Lucy
                                                        and Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban band leader played by Mr. Arnaz, who was Miss Ball&apos;s husband on and off screen for nearly 20 years. </p>
                                                    <p>It was a major national event when, on Jan. 19, 1953, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to Little Ricky on the air the same night Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha
