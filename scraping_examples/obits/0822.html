                                                    <h5>By PATRICK E. TYLER</h5>
                                                    <p> Like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai before him, Deng Xiaoping was among the small group of revolutionary elders who fought as guerrillas for the Communist cause and then dominated the leadership of the People&apos;s
                                                        Republic they proclaimed on Oct. 1, 1949. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Few if any figures in this century matched Mr. Deng for political longevity.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Nearly half a century has passed since Mao first installed Mr. Deng in the upper-reaches of power in China, making him general secretary of the world&apos;s largest Communist Party in 1954.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Twice he was to be dragged down from those heights -- purged as a &apos;&apos;capitalist roader&apos;&apos; in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution and again -- after a remarkable comeback -- following the death of Mao in 1976.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Only with his second resurrection did Mr. Deng begin to consolidate his power, becoming China&apos;s paramount leader in 1978. He was then 74, seemingly too old to be anything but a transitional figure.
                                                        Instead, he reigned for a generation.

As his health slipped precipitously -- his
                                                        last public appearance was during the Lunar New Year festivities in early 1994 -- he seemed further removed from daily decision-making. But still he was consulted to resolve major policy and personnel

                                                        the reforms Mr. Deng ignited may well propel China&apos;s economy to the position of third largest, after the United States and Japan, but China&apos;s prosperity will be diluted by the increasing
                                                        number of Chinese. Nearly 270 million will not have jobs at the turn of the century.

                                                        a race against time as population growth and incomplete reform were adding to the siege of China&apos;s straining foundations. Shortages of water and arable land mounted, and unchecked industrial
                                                        pollution contributed to an overall degradation of the environmental landscape.

Most Chinese who have watched a television or used a washing machine or dialed a telephone have done so only since Mr. Deng came to power. The struggle to survive in the

                                                    <p> During most of those years, Mr. Deng symbolized the Chinese aspiration to move beyond the ideological extremism that had marked the Maoist era and reclaim for the Chinese a long-denied prosperity.

                                                        Communist Party.

                                                        Mr. Deng&apos;s early reputation as a visionary who delivered the Chinese from suffering was blackened most notably by his leading role in ordering the June 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. The tank and machine-gun assault
                                                        on students and bystanders that came to be known as the Tiananmen massacre diminished his prestige as a world leader and isolated China politically for years afterward.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> A generation of students and intellectuals, many of whom had fled the country, held Mr. Deng responsible and scorned his image. But much of the country, particularly the peasantry, seemed grateful to
                                                        Mr. Deng for providing them with the first prolonged period of peace and stability in this century. If intellectuals could not forgive the brutality at Tiananmen, peasants could not forget that he
                                                        had ended a long chapter of deprivation.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In foreign policy, Mr. Deng negotiated an end to the last vestige of British colonial power in China with an agreement to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty later this year. Reunification with Taiwan
                                                        eluded him, but he worked to settle China&apos;s border disputes, normalize relations with the United States and repair the 30-year rift with the Soviet Union.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> His goal was to focus the totality of national energy on China&apos;s economic development. Even the Chinese military had to serve the new national priority by accepting deep budget cuts through the
                                                        1980&apos;s.

                                                    <p> As a leader, Mr. Deng cut a most unusual figure in the Chinese pantheon.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> He was emperor-like in a century in which the Chinese overthrew their last emperor after three millenniums of imperial rule. Mr. Deng was first among equals in the small circle of revolutionary elders
                                                        who survived Mao. The posts and titles Mr. Deng held in the Communist Party hierarchy never quite equaled or conveyed his stature as paramount leader, a term that seemed invented for Mr. Deng, who
                                                        was still arguably the most powerful citizen of China when he died.

                                                        wisdom was that Mr. Deng was five feet tall but, as one scholar observed, &apos;&apos;that was surely an exaggeration.&apos;&apos;

                                                        which makes his words slur together like a gargle. There are few signs of liveliness of mind, of wit or humor, and no sustained, systematic pursuit of ideas.&apos;&apos;

                                                        old colleagues and old friends does he like to talk, and carries on in a loud voice.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Henry A. Kissinger, who helped to engineer the normalization of relations with China during the Nixon Administration, once pronounced Mr. Deng a &apos;&apos;nasty little man.&apos;&apos; But others found
                                                        a certain charm.

                                                        Although he picked his political heirs carefully, Mr. Deng was plagued by the problem of succession. In May 1989 he worried aloud to the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev: &apos;&apos;The only thing that can&apos;t be brought to pass is the abolition
                                                        from the system of lifelong positions for leaders.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> That same year, Mr. Deng named Jiang Zemin, the current President and Communist Party chief, as the &apos;&apos;core&apos;&apos; of the &apos;&apos;third generation&apos;&apos; leadership, after him
                                                        and Mao. But many Chinese say Mr. Jiang could face trouble managing the party now without Mr. Deng behind him and could be swept aside, much as Mao&apos;s nominal successor, Hua Guofeng, was swept
                                                        aside by Mr. Deng. </p>
                                                    <p>Neither intellectual nor poet, Mr. Deng was best known as a pragmatist who focused on the problems of the day, unencumbered by history or ideology. His years as a military strategist and political commissar,
                                                        balancing real military capabilities against the expectations of politicians, gave him a keen sense of what was possible.

                                                    <p> He is best remembered for his simple maxims rather than for coherent policies: To defeat ideological attacks from the Maoists, he often quoted the Maoist dictum, &apos;&apos;Seek truth from facts.&apos;&apos;
                                                        To emphasize that there was no road map for economic reform, he said the Chinese must &apos;&apos;cross the river by feeling out the stones with our feet.&apos;&apos; His most famous aphorism was
                                                        an old proverb from his native Sichuan: &apos;&apos;It doesn&apos;t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.&apos;&apos; </p>

                                                        of disorder and the violence it has wrought explains his deep opposition to political pluralism.

Mr. Zhao&apos;s liberal tone in economic reform and political tolerance was buried by
                                                        new edicts from the hard-line faction led by Prime Minister Li Peng.

                                                        revolutionary after spending five years in France on a work-study program, where he toiled in filthy factories that paid subsistence wages to Chinese.

                                                    <p> During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when Mao sought to tear down the Communist Party leadership, Mr. Deng was branded a public enemy, humiliated in &apos;&apos;struggle sessions&apos;&apos; and
                                                        sent to work in a tractor factory. His younger brother, Deng Shuping, was driven to suicide in 1967 after weeks of abuse by Red Guards.

                                                        window in September 1968. The fall broke his back and he suffered for months without adequate medical attention; he remains paralyzed.

                                                    <p> As a young revolutionary, he exhorted peasants to kill landowners because, he is said to have reasoned, once the masses had blood on their hands, they would be more committed to the Communist cause.

                                                    <p> Mr. Deng would later earn a reputation as a pragmatist, but in the late 1950&apos;s he was an exponent of political repression and accelerated socialism. After intellectuals responded to Mao&apos;s invitation
                                                        to &apos;&apos;let a hundred flowers bloom&apos;&apos; -- to express freely their criticisms of the Communist Party -- Mr. Deng helped lead a witch hunt against those who had taken the invitation
                                                        in full measure.

                                                    <p> In 1980, Mr. Deng acknowledged that the Anti-Rightist Campaign had been excessive, but he asserted that the essence of the struggle had been &apos;&apos;necessary and correct.&apos;&apos;

                                                        was used to buttress the absolute right of the sovereign, but later evolved under Confucian traditions of benevolence and wisdom.

                                                        seemed able or, indeed, willing to completely bury the imperial tradition.

                                                    <p> Mao created a cult of personality so broad and pervasive that he had the whole nation mimicking his style of drab clothing, memorizing his quotations from little red books and living under the gaze of

                                                    <p> Under Mr. Deng, China broke out of the monochromatic Mao era to life in full color. A walk down Nanjing Road in Shanghai today reveals the new Chinese glitz under the sparkle of a thousand boutique windows.
                                                        In the throng of new consumers, the hairdos bounce with the latest styles from Hong Kong above leather jackets trimmed in fur.

                                                        as an &apos;&apos;unrepentant capitalist-roader,&apos;&apos; it appeared that the notorious Gang of Four, the radicals led by Mao&apos;s wife, Jiang Qing, had defeated him. Mao himself decreed that

                                                    <p> Deng Xiaoping was born Deng Xixian to a landlord family in the heart of China&apos;s most populous province, Sichuan, on Aug. 22, 1904.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The Deng household was the wealthiest in the village of Paifang. Mr. Deng&apos;s father, Deng Wenming, controlled about 25 acres of land with an annual output of about 10 tons of grain. When his wife
                                                        could not bear children, he took a second wife, or concubine, whose family name was Dan. Her dowry in 1901 included the red-lacquered bed in which the future Chinese leader was born three years later.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Deng was just entering primary school in 1911 when the last Qing Emperor was overthrown by an amalgam of forces led by Sun Yat-sen.

                                                        By 1919, Mr. Deng&apos;s father, joining the nation-building spirit of the times, decided to send his son to France for a work-study program. When Mr. Deng, age 16, and 200 other students boarded a steamer at Shanghai on Sept. 11, 1920, he was never to
                                                        see his parents again.

                                                        In Paris he befriended the articulate and dashing Zhou Enlai, an &apos;&apos;elder brother&apos;&apos; to Mr. Deng. By 1922, Mr. Deng had joined the Communist Party of Chinese Youth in Europe.

                                                    <p>To escape the French police, Mr. Deng plotted his departure from France in 1926. His route took him to Moscow, where his revolutionary training continued.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p> In 1929, Mr. Deng led his first successful Communist uprising, in southwestern Guangxi province. But his campaign toward Guangzhou proved a disaster. His Seventh Red Army in tatters, Mr. Deng reached
                                                        Mao Zedong&apos;s base in 1931. His loyalty to Mao&apos;s vision of the revolution briefly cost him his freedom during the internal party struggles of the early 1930&apos;s.

                                                    <p> In October 1933, Chiang Kai-shek marshaled one million men to crush Mao&apos;s Communist base in Jiangxi province by building a chain of block houses across the countryside. Thus began in 1934 a yearlong,
                                                        6,000-mile retreat known as the Long March. Death from exposure, suffering and frequent attacks thinned the Communist Army from 70,000 to 10,000 as it passed through treacherous and hostile country.

                                                    <p> Rehabilitated after his first purge, Mr. Deng set out on the Long March as the editor of Red Star, the party paper. By the time the routed army reached the caves of Yanan in remote Shaanxi province,
                                                        Mr. Deng had nearly died of typhoid fever. And Mao had reversed his own political fortunes and never again lost his command of the revolution. Mr. Deng was one of his closest lieutenants.

                                                        Nationalists for the affection of the masses.

                                                        of political discipline in marshaling it. The battlefield hardships Mr. Deng endured created many lasting bonds with China&apos;s top field commanders. These bonds also served his rise in the party
                                                        and may have saved his life when he was later purged. </p>

                                                        she had studied physics. Mao attended the wedding in September 1939. </p>
                                                    <p> Never active in politics, Zhuo Lin, the name she adopted in Yanan, bore five children between 1940 and 1952 and stood by her husband through a series of crises.

                                                    <p> In addition to his wife, Mr. Deng&apos;s survivors are his five children: the oldest, Deng Lin, an artist who has exhibited her work in New York and Paris; Deng Pufang, the paraplegic son, who for the

                                                        propelled him upward. He was appointed secretary general of the Central Committee in June 1954 and, by 1956, secretary general of the Communist Party. With Yang Shangkun as his deputy, Mr. Deng virtually
                                                        controlled the party personnel apparatus, placing thousands of cadres in jobs and building a party network that became the foundation of his power.

With the detonation of a fission bomb weighing 3,410 pounds on
                                                        Oct. 16, 1964, China became a nuclear power.

                                                        in a secret speech in 1956, Mao was appalled that his putative heirs seemed to identify with the attack. If Stalin&apos;s position was not sacred in Soviet history, Mao reasoned, neither was Mao&apos;s

                                                    <b> Great Leap Forward, And Many Setbacks </b>
                                                    <p>With a series of internal political campaigns, Mao began assaulting what he perceived as his many enemies. The Anti-Rightist movement of 1957 led into the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The rupture in relations
                                                        with the Soviet Union soon followed, becoming apparent in 1960 with the abrupt withdrawal of Soviet aid. In July 1963, a final effort was made to patch up the ideological split when Mr. Deng was
                                                        dispatched to Moscow in what proved to be the last formal contact between leaders of the two Communist parties for 26 years. </p>
                                                    <p>In the early stages of the political campaigns, Mr. Deng was the instrument of Mao&apos;s revenge, sending thousands of Chinese intellectuals to manual labor camps and prisons. </p>
                                                    <p> Mao was not satisfied. He wanted to propel China forward with agricultural communes and steel production. His Great Leap Forward was perhaps the largest policy-induced economic disaster in history. Backyard
                                                        furnaces turned the peasantry&apos;s tools and cookware into useless molten globs. China&apos;s harvest rotted in the fields. No one dared tell Mao of the failure; grain exports continued. Then famine
                                                        struck.

                                                    <p> As many as 30 million Chinese died of starvation in the next four years. </p>
                                                    <p>The catastrophe seemed to remold Mr. Deng, and he thereafter placed more emphasis on practical measures for economic growth, especially those that contained incentives for China&apos;s peasantry to increase
                                                        individual production.

                                                    <p> As Mr. Deng worked more closely with Yang Shangkun and President Liu Shaoqi, Mao began to suspect they were plotting against him. He complained the party leadership was treating him like a &apos;&apos;dead
                                                        ancestor&apos;&apos; and he singled out Mr. Deng for making decisions like an &apos;&apos;emperor.&apos;&apos; </p>
                                                    <p> Luckily for Mr. Deng, he slipped and broke his leg in 1958, thus avoiding the worst confrontation over Mao&apos;s policies at the Lushan conference of 1959.

                                                        Mao mounted a withering counterattack and Mr. Deng did not escape for long. Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to destroy his adversaries in the party. He exhorted the masses to &apos;&apos;bombard the party headquarters&apos;&apos; and thrust
                                                        China into the decade of chaos that fostered civil conflict in every school, factory and municipality.

                                                    <p> Thousands of young Red Guards were allowed into Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in central Beijing. They rampaged through the homes of President Liu, Mr. Deng and other leaders. Mr. Deng was branded
                                                        the &apos;&apos;No. 2 capitalist-roader&apos;&apos; in the party after President Liu.

                                                        children were dispersed. Mr. Deng and his wife were sent to Jiangxi province, where they worked in a tractor factory and gardened.

                                                        with the Soviet Union; the economy was in chaos, and Prime Minister Zhou had cancer.

                                                        white socks and black oxfords. It was Mr. Deng, recalled a month earlier to help heal the country and perhaps succeed Zhou.

                                                        their opposition to the radicals. Mr. Deng was blamed for the revolt and Mao, near death, agreed to purge him for a final time. Mr. Deng was placed under house arrest.

                                                        when he was able to establish himself as the country&apos;s paramount leader.

                                                        was deferred, except for strategic weapons to maintain China&apos;s nuclear deterrent.

                                                    <p>
                                                        He told President Carter in January 1979, &apos;&apos;The Chinese need a long period of peace to realize their full modernization.&apos;&apos; And to American businessmen, he said China needed their money and technology.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> After establishing full diplomatic relations with Washington on Jan. 1, 1979, Mr. Deng made a whirlwind tour of the United States that was full of extraordinary images, from Mr. Deng kissing the children
                                                        who sang in Chinese at the Kennedy Center to wearing a white 10-gallon hat in Texas. </p>
                                                    <p> Back home, it seemed for a time that Mr. Deng&apos;s openness to economic reform would lead him to support significant democratic reforms.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> He told party leaders that he endorsed the spirit of China&apos;s new democracy movement. &apos;&apos;Democracy has to be institutionalized and written into law,&apos;&apos; he said.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> But when Wei Jingsheng and his Democracy Wall colleagues turned their criticism on Mr. Deng, the Chinese leader smashed the movement and persecuted its intellectual leaders. Mr. Deng began to equate
                                                        democracy with the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. &apos;&apos;Our people have just gone through a decade of suffering&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;cannot afford further chaos,&apos;&apos;
                                                        he said.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Deng wanted the energy of the economic reformers, but could not tolerate their political challenge.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <b> The Focus of It All: Economic Change </b>
                                                    <p> Of the changes that Mr. Deng oversaw, economic restructuring was central. And the Chinese often did not wait for new policies as they &apos;&apos;dove into the sea,&apos;&apos; the metaphor for going
                                                        into business.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Farmers began raising fish, shrimp and fruit for new markets that sprang up in every township. Private and collective enterprises multiplied as former peasants began manufacturing toys, fireworks, bricks,
                                                        clothing -- all manner of everyday items.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The agricultural changes were easily accomplished and the farmers, by any previous standard, were getting rich. The first thing many did was to build a new houses, creating a huge demand in the construction
                                                        industry.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In industrial reforms, Mr. Deng started cautiously, creating special economic zones in China&apos;s coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, where tax subsidies attracted Hong Kong&apos;s manufacturing
                                                        tycoons. Mr. Deng said the coastal provinces could get rich first, but the real strategy was incrementalism because Mr. Deng feared failure and discredit at the hands of the party&apos;s Marxist
                                                        conservatives. </p>
                                                    <p> The economic zones ignited an export explosion that continues today, with China dominating the world market in toys, shoes and textiles. The zones multiplied, forming a rimland of coastal wealth, but
                                                        extending inland only to major cities like Beijing.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Along with the wealth came scourges. Child labor and sweat shops appeared as parents sent their children to work, not to school. Shoddy and unsafe factories became firetraps where thousands died in accidents
                                                        or fires. Fly-by-night companies produced dangerous or useless products, including one ubiquitous contraption that promised to make people taller.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Criminal gangs, prostitution and the sale of women into bondage spread from rural to urban areas. Old Communist cadres who wiped out narcotics trafficking in the 1950&apos;s were repulsed at its return.
                                                        Heroin and opium were back.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Grafting the success of the coastal provinces onto the larger Chinese economy proved beyond Mr. Deng&apos;s capabilities. Today the core of China&apos;s economy, the state-owned industrial sector, remains
                                                        largely unreformed, mired in debt, a slave to party apparatchiks, many of whom are corrupt or incompetent. </p>
                                                    <p> Over 18 years, Mr. Deng&apos;s attempts to restructure this monolithic sector, the source of the Communist Party&apos;s power and revenue, have led to a series of &apos;&apos;boom and bust&apos;&apos;
                                                        inflationary cycles that continue today.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Deng wanted the party to reform the state factories, to make the managers responsible for their profits and losses, and to raise worker productivity.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Bankruptcy, as a concept, entered the Communist lexicon for the first time. But the political consequences of widespread layoffs always prevented Mr. Deng&apos;s reformers from acting boldly.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> When they did act, there were no macroeconomic levers to adjust the money supply, only blunt instruments of jawboning from Beijing. </p>
                                                    <p> When inflation got out of control after the price reform drives of mid-1988, panic buying added to the unrest that sent hundreds of thousands of workers into the streets in support of democracy, but
                                                        also to protest corruption and mismanagement.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The military crackdown at Tiananmen Square and martial law brought the hard-liners back to pre-eminence in economic policy and Mr. Deng had to go along. After the removal of Zhao Ziyang in 1989, Mr. Deng and the other revolutionary leaders could not agree
                                                        on who should rule. Their compromise was Jiang Zemin, the Shanghai party boss whose strongest suit was consensus-building. </p>
                                                    <p> The economic bubble that had expanded in the late 1980&apos;s finally burst, the economy fell in on itself, production ground to a halt in many industries, foreign investors fled and credit dried up.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In November 1989, Mr. Deng announced his retirement from his last formal post, head of the Central Military Commission. But the emphasis in Chinese culture on seniority made it impossible for him to
                                                        leave politics, or for politics to function without his intervention.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The failed Soviet coup in August 1991 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Communist Party seemed to convince Mr. Deng that the most powerful antidote to such a fate for Chinese Communism would
                                                        be economic growth. He began to criticize conservatives who obsessed over Western &apos;&apos;plots&apos;&apos; to topple Communism through &apos;&apos;peaceful evolution.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;Say less and do more,&apos;&apos; he admonished them, trying to return their focus to practical steps to promote economic growth.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> The reforms were turning loose forces that eventually would challenge the party, whose ideology had lost its moral sway. Millions of Chinese were turning to religion and Confucianism, seeking a moral
                                                        structure to replace the void left by the party.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Deng understood that economic reform and the forces that it unleashed in Chinese society would eventually challenge the Leninist rule of the party.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Thus began a period in which the Communist Party&apos;s legitimacy arose from its ability to deliver economic growth and rising incomes.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;In the end, convincing those who do not believe in socialism will depend on our nation&apos;s development,&apos;&apos; Mr. Deng said in late 1991. &apos;&apos;If we can reach a comfortable
                                                        standard of living by the end of this century, then that will wake them up a bit. And in the next century when we, as a socialist country, join the middle ranks of the developed nations, that will
                                                        help to convince them. Most of these people will genuinely see that they were mistaken.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p>But even as Mr. Deng spoke, the hard-liners in Beijing refused to act and Jiang Zemin was paralyzed by the lack of consensus.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> At the beginning of 1992, Mr. Deng was rampant against his old adversaries, principally the hard-line faction led by the conservative patriarch Chen Yun. Mr. Chen and many other elders retired as Mr.
                                                        Deng dominated the 14th Party Congress, which enshrined a new national goal of creating a &apos;&apos;socialist market economy&apos;&apos; by 2000. </p>
                                                    <p> Mr. Deng also moved against Yang Shangkun and his younger half-brother, Gen. Yang Baibing, who had created a power base in the military that was threatening the post-Deng political order. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But the pace of reform was too fast for Mr. Deng&apos;s successors, who craved social stability above all to consolidate their rule. Unemployment, sagging state industries and labor unrest bedeviled the leadership up to the moment of Mr. Deng&apos;s death.
                                                    </p>

                                                        And the pro-democracy forces have gradually been suppressed. Instead of charting a clear path, Mr. Deng&apos;s successors stumbled politically, seeking concessions from the world on trade and human rights but offering little in return.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>As long as Mr. Deng drew breath, it seemed that China could cope with its contradictions. But as his health inexorably declined, the Chinese seemed to pause and to wonder about the future.
