                                                        Shirley Booth, an actress whose warmth and versatility brought her acclaim on stage, screen and television, died on Friday at her home in North Chatham, Mass. She was 94 years old.

                                                    <p>
                                                        She died after a brief illness, said David Hunt of the Nickerson Funeral Home in Chatham, who announced her death yesterday.

                                                        Miss Booth was celebrated for never giving a bad performance. She portrayed many quick-witted women with acerbic tongues, but gained her greatest recognition for playing an ingratiating but drab, garrulous housewife clinging to wistful illusions in &quot;Come

Miss Booth&apos;s portrayals of a woman struggling to
                                                        cope with her husband&apos;s alcoholism and their barren life together garnered every dramatic award, including a Tony and an Oscar. </p>
