He was 85 years old. The famed psychologist was beset by heart and circulatory troubles and began

                                                    <p>Dr. Jung was one of the great modern adventurers who sought to push back the dark frontiers of man&apos;s mind.</p>

                                                        The Jungian terms such as extrovert and introvert became stock dinner-conversations cliches.

                                                        of sexual conflicts in infancy. The most powerful of these conflicts was the infantile urge to parricide and incest--the Oedipus and Electra complexes.

                                                        While admitting this urge, Dr. Jung said that man&apos;s natural instinct toward religion was perhaps as strong as his sexual instinct, and that man ignored the religious instinct at his peril.

                                                    <p>Dr. Freud traced religion to the child&apos;s helplessness before the outer world and the child&apos;s need to cling to its parents in order to survive.

                                                    <p>The Freudian world was a gloomy jungle in which wandering man was forever stumbling over repressed emotional experiences. Freud and those who formed the hard core of his school believed that there was
                                                        no cure for man&apos;s dilemma except to locate and remove these stumbling-block emotional experiences.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Dr. Jung held, on the contrary, that man was not necessarily doomed forever to be shoved about by traumas over which he could exercise little control. The Jungians derided the Freudian theory that God
                                                        was nothing more than man&apos;s self-created vision of his father, and that good deeds and a desire to advance in the world were only devices to forget more primitive urges and disorders.</p>
                                                    <p>Freud&apos;s world was found by many to be grim and almost hopeless. Dr. Jung&apos;s world was not exactly cozy either, but he believed that man&apos;s unconquerable spirit could make it better. Man
                                                        could do this, Dr. Jung taught, because, in addition to the experiences of each individual, as registered in his subconscious mind, each person had a second group of experiences. This group was the
                                                        collective experience of the race recorded in his subconscious mind. This collective experience included man&apos;s never-ceasing urge toward religion, Dr. Jung said.

                                                    <p>Freud, Dr. Jung and Dr. Alfred Adler were the three great figures in the age of psychology. They influenced Western man&apos;s thinking as it had not been influenced since the publication of the &quot;Origin
                                                        of Species&quot; in 1859. Adler, who likewise broke with the harsher theories of Freud, died in 1937, and Freud died two years later.</p>

                                                    <p>Dr. Jung was born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland. He was a son of Paul Jung, an Evangelical minister, and Emille Freiswerk Jung. The family moved to Basel, where the son obtained a medical
                                                        degree at the university in 1900. He began his psychiatric studies at the University of Zurich. For a doctoral thesis in philosophy he selected the case of a girl affected by somnambulism and professing
                                                        to be a spiritualist medium.</p>
                                                    <p>After additional studies in Paris, Dr. Jung became a lecturer in psychiatry at the University of Zurich and with Dr. Eugen Bleuler, founded the &quot;Zurich School&quot; of depth psychology. In time,
                                                        this school came to be thought of as opposing the &quot;Vienna School&quot; established by Freud. Actually, Drs. Jung and Freud were in agreement as to many of the basic tenets of modern psychology.

                                                    <p>The methods used by Dr. Jung in obtaining the cooperation of the nonconscious factors in the mind were similar to those used by Freud, who acknowledged the value of the large number of controls that
                                                        Dr. Jung had obtained.</p>

                                                        untried method of probing the subconscious mind.

                                                    <p>In 1911 Dr. Jung and a number of other authorities in his field founded the International Psychoanalytic Society. Dr. Jung frequently used this society to further his views on new elements that he believed
                                                        he had found in dreams and fantasies.

                                                    <p>Those who did not agree with all of Dr. Jung&apos;s theories about the human mind criticized him for showing too much interest in such unscientific matters as occultism and witchcraft. The Freudians
                                                        held that he was betraying pure scientific research by digressions into Buddhism and Christianity. At this period, Dr. Jung also explored yoga, alchemy, folklore and obscure tribal religious rites
                                                        and taboos. All this was held by his opponents to be a waste of time and a betrayal of scientific principles.

                                                        Dr. Jung said that, on the contrary, since mankind had devoted so much thought to such matters, they formed part of man&apos;s consciousness of the race. They were in man&apos;s mind, and if you wanted to know about man&apos;s mind, you had to know about
                                                        them.

                                                        was, in the main, wrong. In all events, Dr. Jung said, his statements in this matter had been distorted out of their true meaning by the followers of Hitler.

                                                    <p>In 1935 Dr. Jung became a full professor in the University of Zurich, after having conducted seminars at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology for several years. In 1937, he became the Terry lecturer
                                                        at Yale and spoke on the relationship between psychology and religion. In these lectures he expanded his theory that what he described as &quot;a natural religious function&quot; exists in man. If
                                                        he ignores this urge, man will lose his psychic health, Dr. Jung said.

                                                    <p>In 1945 Dr. Jung gave up his professorship at the University of Basel to concentrate on his research and his writing. Until 1948, there was no definite place where the theories of Dr. Jung were taught
                                                        in a body. In that year, the C. G. Jung Institute was established in Zurich to provide scholars with a place to do advance research in analytical psychology.</p>
                                                    <p>Although Freud and Dr. Jung differed on many of the fundamentals of applied psychology, they remained more or less friendly. They would meet from time to time to discuss their views, and on one occasion
                                                        they talked for twelve hours without a stop. Each would tell the other his dreams and they would give their interpretations of their findings.

                                                        to create the impression on the subject that he was not intruding.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Dr. Jung usually placed his subject in a chair opposite him and made him feel that he, Dr. Jung, was an active part in the examination and that he would share his subject&apos;s experiences with him.

In it Dr. Jung was quoted by the bulletin of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization
                                                        as having said:

His home at Kuessnacht was a handsome villa with yellow walls and a red roof. He maintained a private retreat farther up Lake Lucerne near Bollingen. This retreat was an old stone tower,
                                                        which provided him with a place to rest, meditate and write.

Jung became seriously ill she asked a family friend, Miss Ruth Bailey, an Englishwoman, to take care of her husband in the event of her
                                                        death. Mme. Jung died in 1955 and Dr. Jung&apos;s material needs had been looked after by Miss Bailey since then.
