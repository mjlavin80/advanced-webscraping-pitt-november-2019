                                                    <h5>By JOHN S. WILSON</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Stan Kenton, the band leader, died Saturday night in a Hollywood hospital. He was 67 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Kenton entered Midway Hospital on Aug. 17 after a stroke. His manager, Audrey Coke, said Mr. Kenton had never fully recovered from a skull fracture he suffered in a fall two years ago.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Kenton was the last major jazzband leader to emerge from the Big Band era of 1935-45, and his was one of only a handful of bands that survived when that era came to an end. It was also the most controversial of all the big jazz bands.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The screaming &quot;walls of brass&quot; that were as characteristic of a Kenton performance as the richly somber trombones and the heavy, staccato saxophones were alternately hailed as &quot;progressive&quot; explorations of an alliance between jazz
                                                        and classical music and deplored as sheer noise. Arthur Fiedler, the late conductor of the Boston Pops, called Mr. Kenton the most important link between jazz and the classics. But Albert J. McCarthy,

                                                        because it was performed and recorded by Stan Kenton and his orchestra.&quot;

                                                        At a time when most jazz musicians became established in their early 20&apos;s, Mr. Kenton was relatively old--almost 30--when he formed his band. Born in Wichita, Kan., on Feb. 19, 1912, he grew up in Los Angeles and was playing with local bands or in
                                                        speakeasies and saloons as soon as he graduated from high school.

                                                        After seven years, during which he played for a while with bands led by Everett Hoagland and Gus Arnheim, he took two years off to study music. This shifted his interest from playing to writing and arranging. He began writing experimental arrangements,
                                                        based on his studies, using staccato saxophone ensembles and heavy rhythm accents in the Jimmie Lunceford manner. With these arrangements, he formed a band that made its debut on Memorial Day, 1941,
                                                        at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa Beach, Calif.

                                                        cool.

                                                        popularity.

                                                        everything and said everything I&apos;d planned to say in music.&quot;

From the mid-50&apos;s on, his penchant for experimental works diminished, although he
                                                        continued to get fresh and often provocative material from such arrangers as Bill Holman, Johnny Richards, Bill Russo and Hank Levy.

                                                        not personally involved, the interest began to wane and the project was abandoned after the 1968 season.

He was particularly disturbed that Capitol had allowed his recordings to go out
                                                        of print when fans continued to flock to his appearances throughout the country and began reissuing them on his Creative World label, selling them by mail along with records by a few other groups

Preliminary hearings in the case have been under way in Los Angeles for two weeks. The younger Kenton, who is free on bond, was a

                                                        Stan Kenton, the band leader, died Saturday night in a Hollywood hospital. He was 67 years old.

                                                        Mr. Kenton entered Midway Hospital on Aug. 17 after a stroke. His manager, Audrey Coke, said Mr. Kenton had never fully recovered from a skull fracture he suffered in a fall two years ago.

                                                        Mr. Kenton was the last major jazzband leader to emerge from the Big Band era of 1935-45, and his was one of only a handful of bands that survived when that era came to an end. It was also the most controversial of all the big jazz bands.

                                                        The screaming &quot;walls of brass&quot; that were as characteristic of a Kenton performance as the richly somber trombones and the heavy, staccato saxophones were alternately hailed as &quot;progressive&quot; explorations of an alliance between jazz
                                                        and classical music and deplored as sheer noise. Arthur Fiedler, the late conductor of the Boston Pops, called Mr. Kenton the most important link between jazz and the classics. But Albert J. McCarthy,
                                                        an English critic, declared that Mr. Kenton&apos;s music screamed &quot;because it can make its point no other way.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Kenton took it all in stride.

He conducted with great arm-waving vigor, ending every selection with upstretched
                                                        arms and an ecstatic expression. He had an unwavering belief in his own work, and was a tireless salesman for it, giving it such descriptive titles as &quot;artistry in rhythm,&quot; &quot;progressive

One of his compositions then was called &quot;Machito&quot; in honor of the
                                                        popular Afro-Cuban band leader, while his arrangement of &quot;The Peanut Vendor,&quot; built on Afro-Cuban rhythms, remained a favorite of his followers throughout his career.

Controversy Over Advancement</b></p>

                                                        because it was performed and recorded by Stan Kenton and his orchestra.&quot;

                                                        At a time when most jazz musicians became established in their early 20&apos;s, Mr. Kenton was relatively old--almost 30--when he formed his band. Born in Wichita, Kan., on Feb. 19, 1912, he grew up in Los Angeles and was playing with local bands or in
                                                        speakeasies and saloons as soon as he graduated from high school.

                                                        After seven years, during which he played for a while with bands led by Everett Hoagland and Gus Arnheim, he took two years off to study music. This shifted his interest from playing to writing and arranging. He began writing experimental arrangements,
                                                        based on his studies, using staccato saxophone ensembles and heavy rhythm accents in the Jimmie Lunceford manner. With these arrangements, he formed a band that made its debut on Memorial Day, 1941,
                                                        at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa Beach, Calif.

Once, after going through analysis and finding it &quot;such a thrilling, rewarding thing,&quot; he decided to go to premed school in preparation

From the mid-50&apos;s on, his penchant for experimental works diminished, although he
                                                        continued to get fresh and often provocative material from such arrangers as Bill Holman, Johnny Richards, Bill Russo and Hank Levy.

                                                        of print when fans continued to flock to his appearances throughout the country and began reissuing them on his Creative World label, selling them by mail along with records by a few other groups
                                                        in which he became interested.

                                                        In recent years, Mr. Kenton was on the road with his band so steadily, playing one-night stands for the most part, that he did not maintain a home. When there was a pause in his journeying, and he went &quot;home&quot; to Los Angeles, he checked into
                                                        a hotel.

                                                        His son, Lance Kenton, 21 years old, was accused last year of helping to put a rattlesnake in the mailbox of Paul Morantz, a lawyer who had handled a successful civil suit against Synanon, the controversial drug rehabilitation organization. Mr. Morantz
                                                        recovered from the reptile&apos;s bite.

                                                        Lance Kenton, Charles Dederich, the head of the group, and another member were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Preliminary hearings in the case have been under way in Los Angeles for two weeks. The younger Kenton, who is free on bond, was a
                                                        member of the Imperial Marines, Synanon&apos;s internal security force.

                                                        Stan Kenton had three marriages, including to Ann Richards, who sang with his band. All ended in divorces. He had three children--Leslie, a daughter, from his first marriage; and Dana, a daughter, and Lance from his second--and three grandchildren.
