                                                    <h5>By PETER B. FLINT</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Joan Crawford, who rose from waitress and chorus girl to become one of the great movie stars, died yesterday of a heart attack in her apartment at 158 East 68th Street. She gave her age as 69, but some reference works list her as two to four years older.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Crawford had been a director of the Pepsi-Cola Company since the death of her fourth husband, Alfred N. Steele, the board chairman of the company, in 1959, but she had not been actively involved in the business in recent months.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A spokesman for Pepsi-Cola said Miss Crawford had no history of cardiac trouble and had appeared to be in good health except for recent complaints of back pains.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Crawford was a quintessential superstar--an epitome of timeless glamour who personified for decades the dreams and disappointments of millions of American women.
                                                    </p>

Her mother and stepfather soon separated and, from the age of 9, she had to work, first in a laundry, helping her mother, and then in two

                                                        She plunged into her movie apprenticeship as a chorus girl in &quot;Pretty Ladies,&quot; a Zasu Pitts comedy; an ingenue in &quot;Old Clothes&quot; with Jackie Coogan, and a featured dancing role in &quot;Sally, Irene and Mary.&quot; She was voted a Wampas
                                                        &quot;baby star,&quot; won a new contract and, because Lucille LeSueur was regarded as awkward to pronounce, was given the name Joan Crawford, the winning entry in a movie-magazine contest.

                                                        She gained experience and billing playing opposite such actors as Lon Chaney, William Haines and John Gilbert, and rocketed to fame in &quot;Our Dancing Daughters.&quot; She passed the talking and singing test in 1929, in &quot;Untamed,&quot; co-starring
                                                        Robert Montgomery, and made eight movies over the years with Clark Gable, most of them box-office hits. They included &quot;Dancing Lady,&quot; gliding with Fred Astaire in his movie debut, and &quot;Strange

                                                        At M.-G.-M. Miss Crawford occasionally broke away from stereotyped casting and won acclaim for distinctive performances. But the best roles went to Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer, the wife of Irving G. Thalberg, the studio&apos;s executive production manager.
                                                        After the two actresses retired, Greer Garson got the plums. Frustrated by formula films, which she termed &quot;undiluted hokum,&quot; Miss Crawford asked Metro to drop her contract in 1942, and
                                                        she left the studio after 17 years.

                                                        She joined Warner Brothers, but rejected scripts for more than two years until her triumphal return in &quot;Mildred Pierce,&quot; adapted from a mordant novel by James C. Cain.

Image Is Ageless</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In this and many other movies, she showed, as Richard Schickel wrote in &quot;The Stars,&quot; published in 1962, a mastery &quot;of what the trade knows as the &apos;woman&apos;s picture&apos;,&quot; in which &quot;she suffers incredible agonies of the
                                                        spirit in her attempts to achieve love and or success. The women suffer along with Miss Crawford, but are reassured by what they know of her own career, which clearly states that a woman can triumph
                                                        in a man&apos;s world.&quot;

                                                        In her later career she projected a kind of ageless image. Her roles included the emotionally confused &quot;Daisy Kenyon,&quot; a carnival girl and convict in &quot;Flamingo Road,&quot; a shrew in &quot;Harriet Craig,&quot; a hoofer in &quot;Torch Song,&quot;
                                                        a western ranch-gang leader in &quot;Johnny Guitar,&quot; a lonely spinster who marries a psychotic youth in &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and many other vehicles of ordeal and anguish.

She long talked of going on the stage, but uncharacteristically
                                                        said later that she lacked &quot;the guts&quot; to appear before a large live audience.

Imposed Discipline</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In Hollywood she had determinedly improved herself, developing culture and polish. Her first marriage, to Douglas Fairbanks Jr., introduced her to the exotic social world of Pickfair, the home of Douglas Sr. and Mary Pickford. Franchot Tone helped her
                                                        study classical drama and innovative acting techniques. Miss Crawford later described her marriages to them and to Phillip Terry as &quot;dollhouse&quot; unions. But her marriage to Mr. Steele, she
                                                        said, gave her greater emotional stability than she had ever known.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Some interviewers wrote that she imposed her perfectionism on her four adopted children, being overly strict with them. To these assertions, she replied: &quot;I&apos;ve tried to provide my children with what I didn&apos;t have: constructive discipline,
                                                        a sense of security, a sense of sharing.&quot; &quot;Sloppiness has never been tolerated in our home, nor has rudeness,&quot; and &quot;They&apos;re going into a world that isn&apos;t easy, a world
                                                        where unless you are self-sufficient and strong, you can be destroyed.&quot;

                                                    <p>
                                                        Some years ago, leaving Manhattan&apos;s &quot;21&quot; Club, she was greeted by a group of construction workers, one shouting, &quot;Hey, Joanie!&quot; She cordially shook hands with several of them. One surveyed her carefully and remarked: &quot;They
                                                        don&apos;t make them like you anymore, baby.&quot;

                                                        Miss Crawford is survived by her four children: Mrs. Cathy Lalonde, Mrs. Cynthia Jordan Crawford, Christina Crawford, and Christopher, and four grandchildren.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Joan Crawford, who rose from waitress and chorus girl to become one of the great movie stars, died yesterday of a heart attack in her apartment at 158 East 68th Street. She gave her age as 69, but some reference works list her as two to four years older.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Crawford had been a director of the Pepsi-Cola Company since the death of her fourth husband, Alfred N. Steele, the board chairman of the company, in 1959, but she had not been actively involved in the business in recent months.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A spokesman for Pepsi-Cola said Miss Crawford had no history of cardiac trouble and had appeared to be in good health except for recent complaints of back pains.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Miss Crawford was a quintessential superstar--an epitome of timeless glamour who personified for decades the dreams and disappointments of millions of American women.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        With a wind-blown bob, mocking eyes and swirling short skirt, she spun to stardom in 1928, frenziedly dancing the Charleston stop a table in the silent melodrama &quot;Our Dancing Daughters.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a frivolous flapper she quickly made a series of spin-offs, including &quot;Our Modern Maidens,&quot; &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot; and &quot;This Modern Age.&quot; Endowed with a low voice, she easily made the transition to sound pictures and went
                                                        on to become one of the more endurable movie queens.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Her career, a chorine-to-grande dame rise, with some setbacks, was due largely to determination, shrewd timing, flexibility, hard work and discipline.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Self-educated and intensely professional, Miss Crawford studied and trained assiduously to learn her art. She made the most of her large blue eyes, wide mouth, broad shoulders and slim figured and eventually became an Oscar-winning dramatic actress.
                                                    </p>

                                                        In more than 80 movies, she adapted easily to changing times and tastes. When audiences began to tire of one image, she toiled to produce a new one. She made the changes with pace-setting makeup, coiffures, costumes--and craftsmanship.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        From a symbol of flaming youth in the Jazz Age, she successively portrayed a shopgirl, a sophisticate, a tenacious woman fighting for success in love and/or a career in a male-dominated milieu, and later a repressed and anguished older woman.

Her mother and stepfather soon separated and, from the age of 9, she had to work, first in a laundry, helping her mother, and then in two

Image Is Ageless</b></p>

                                                        In this and many other movies, she showed, as Richard Schickel wrote in &quot;The Stars,&quot; published in 1962, a mastery &quot;of what the trade knows as the &apos;woman&apos;s picture&apos;,&quot; in which &quot;she suffers incredible agonies of the
                                                        spirit in her attempts to achieve love and or success. The women suffer along with Miss Crawford, but are reassured by what they know of her own career, which clearly states that a woman can triumph
                                                        in a man&apos;s world.&quot;

                                                        In her later career she projected a kind of ageless image. Her roles included the emotionally confused &quot;Daisy Kenyon,&quot; a carnival girl and convict in &quot;Flamingo Road,&quot; a shrew in &quot;Harriet Craig,&quot; a hoofer in &quot;Torch Song,&quot;
                                                        a western ranch-gang leader in &quot;Johnny Guitar,&quot; a lonely spinster who marries a psychotic youth in &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and many other vehicles of ordeal and anguish.

She long talked of going on the stage, but uncharacteristically
                                                        said later that she lacked &quot;the guts&quot; to appear before a large live audience.

Imposed Discipline</b></p>

                                                        In Hollywood she had determinedly improved herself, developing culture and polish. Her first marriage, to Douglas Fairbanks Jr., introduced her to the exotic social world of Pickfair, the home of Douglas Sr. and Mary Pickford. Franchot Tone helped her
                                                        study classical drama and innovative acting techniques. Miss Crawford later described her marriages to them and to Phillip Terry as &quot;dollhouse&quot; unions. But her marriage to Mr. Steele, she
                                                        said, gave her greater emotional stability than she had ever known.

                                                        Some interviewers wrote that she imposed her perfectionism on her four adopted children, being overly strict with them. To these assertions, she replied: &quot;I&apos;ve tried to provide my children with what I didn&apos;t have: constructive discipline,
                                                        a sense of security, a sense of sharing.&quot; &quot;Sloppiness has never been tolerated in our home, nor has rudeness,&quot; and &quot;They&apos;re going into a world that isn&apos;t easy, a world
                                                        where unless you are self-sufficient and strong, you can be destroyed.&quot;

One surveyed her carefully and remarked: &quot;They
                                                        don&apos;t make them like you anymore, baby.&quot;
