                                                    <h5>Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES</h5>
                                                    <p>
                                                        MOSCOW, June 18.--Maxim Gorky, most famous of contemporary Russian novelists, died shortly before noon today of heart disease, the result of pulmonary congestion following grip. He had been ill for two weeks. His heart weakness had already given rise
                                                        to anxiety, which was greatly accentuated yesterday. He died in his country villa, about thirty miles from Moscow, at the age of 68.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Gorky had become one of the most popular figures in the U.S.S.R. in recent years as he gradually passed from a sympathizer to one of the warmest supporters of the Soviet regime. He played a leading role at the International Writers Congress in Moscow
                                                        in the Summer of 1934. His photograph in the congress hall was nearly as large as Stalin&apos;s.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although he did not participate in politics directly and was not a member of the Bolshevist party, he championed the Soviet cause unequivocally. Tverskaya Street, one of the leading thoroughfares of Moscow, was named Gorky Street in his honor.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>

Honors--more honors than for any other man in Soviet Russia--were showered upon the author. The ancient city of Nizhni Novgorod lost its old name and was called
                                                        Gorky in 1932. The largest airplane in the world at the time was named after the author of &quot;Chelkash.&quot; It was wrecked in 1935. The main literary institute in the U.S.S.R. has been called
                                                        the Maxim Gorky Institute.

                                                        of the Russian people has been enormous, the new school of Soviet writers has rebelled to a certain extent against his somewhat ponderous writings of later years. His fame, at the turn of the century,
                                                        was international. In later years he has been more of a semi-political figure in Soviet Russia.

He was born in Nizhni Novgorod, Russia, March 14, 1868, the son of a journeyman upholsterer.

Abandoned by His Parents</b></p>

                                                        When only 5 years old Gorky was abandoned by his parents and was cared for by his grandfather, described as a miserly and brutal old man. The lot of the nomad, which he immortalized in later years, appeared to be his destiny. Desperate struggles with
                                                        cold and hunger, neglect and misery were his lot from his earliest days. He was compelled to leave school when he was taken down with cholera and he never returned. His father contracted the same
                                                        illness and died, and upon Gorky&apos;s recovery he found that his mother had died of consumption. The grandparent informed his convalescent boy that he had lost his hoarded wealth and that he must
                                                        go to work.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Tramping about the Volga region, he chanced upon Captain Mikail Samouir, an old seafaring man, who liked the bright and companionable vagabond. The captain, an educated man, offered to teach the youth to read, but at first Gorky hated books, and it took
                                                        him a long time to acquire an appreciation of the beauties stored in the books the captain offered him. At first he read the Bible, then the Arabian Nights, and at length became fascinated with the
                                                        works of the Russian masters of the day. When he realized how ignorant he was he sought an education.

                                                        He had read somewhere that Leo Tolstoy got his education at the University of Kazan, so, at the age of 15, he bade the captain good-bye and set out for Kazan. He was destined to disappointment at the end of his journey, for, to his chagrin, he learned
                                                        for the first time that an education such as he desired had to be bought. He therefore went to work in a bakeshop, earning the sum of 3 rubles per month--$1.50 in the coin of the United States.

                                                        In his short story &quot;Twenty-one and One Other,&quot; he immortalized the miserable and dingy bakeshop, with its ceaselessly toiling bakers and fiery tongues leaping from the bake oven. Fantastic pictures set his imagination aglow, for he had heard
                                                        of the city of Tiflis, with its semi-barbaric inhabitants. He left the bakeshop bound for the Crimea, but apparently on this attempt he did not get far. A stranger stopped him as he lounged about
                                                        the university preparatory to taking his departure. The man was a lawyer, who, after hearing the story of the impetuous boy, offered him employment. Gorky became a clerk in the law office, and then
                                                        followed long days of hard study.

There he wrote his first short story, but his best work in this line was not done until some years later, when he met Vladimir Korolenko,
                                                        the famous Russian short-story writer. Unlike most Russian writers, Gorky was received with great enthusiasm. He found an echo within the hearts of the multitude. All over the world his work began
                                                        to meet with approval, as it was translated into many languages.

His favorite type, however, was
                                                        the man in revolt against society. Through his years of association with that class he wrote from personal knowledge and easily enlisted the sympathy of his readers. He also produced some plays with
                                                        high ideals, such as &quot;At the Lowest Depths,&quot; which met with great success in Moscow.

                                                        propaganda. Several times he was cast into prison because of his seditious utterances, and after incarceration at Riga in January, 1905, he virtually became an exile for eight years.

Andreieva, an actress, and not legally married to the revolutionist, a revulsion of sentiment set in and society
                                                        refused to have anything more to do with him, despite the explanation that under the Russian laws it had been impossible to obtain a divorce from his wife, with whom he had not lived for years. Admission
                                                        to New York hotels was refused him, and, finally, after a period of seclusion, he left America, bitterly denouncing the country. In 1907, while living in the shadow of death from tuberculosis at
                                                        Capri, Italy, Gorky married the actress.

In 1914, however, he returned to Russia. Soon thereafter the World War started. Although 46 years old, with health undermined, and a supposedly confirmed
                                                        pacifist, Gorky enlisted in the Russian Army as a private and served at the front in Galicia. He said a European disaster would be brought about if Germany won the war, and he was willing to sacrifice
                                                        his principles to avert such a catastrophe.

When
                                                        Kerensky was overthrown, Gorky found himself in bitter disagreement with the Bolsheviki and attacked them almost daily in editorials and bulletins issued over his name. His opposition did not last
                                                        long, however, and he was soon won over to the Bolshevist cause.

                                                    <p>
                                                        His adherence to the Soviet cause was questioned at various times, due to temporary quarrels with the powers that be, but, generally speaking, he never wavered in his support of the principles for which the Bolsheviki stood. In 1918 he was appointed chief
                                                        of the Soviet Bureau of Propaganda, and early the next year he was elected a member of the Petrograd Soviet. His wife became an official of the Department of Education.

                                                        Gorky&apos;s political connection with the Soviet ended in 1924, when, either because his health was bad or because he felt himself temporarily out of sympathy with the regime, he left Russia for Germany, France and Italy.

Faithful to Soviet Creed</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a matter of fact, Gorky was to show himself by his later actions and statements to be heartily in accord with Soviet principles. When the tenth anniversary of the Bolshevist regime was celebrated, Gorky sent a letter of greeting to the Soviet Government.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        While in Russia Gorky abandoned his literary work, only to take it up again when he was abroad. For a year or two after leaving Russia he was believed to be slowly dying of his tubercular trouble, but, after purchasing a villa in Sorrento, Italy, and
                                                        taking up his residence there, he recovered his health completely. His most important literary work, composed at Sorrento, was his autobiography, written in the form of a diary, but he also wrote
                                                        several novels and plays, considered by critics to be as fine as any of his early work. On his sixtieth birthday, which occurred in March, 1928, the Soviet Government honored him by issuing a special
                                                        set of postage stamps bearing his portrait. Gorky was the first writer so honored in Russia.

                                                        MOSCOW, June 18.--Maxim Gorky, most famous of contemporary Russian novelists, died shortly before noon today of heart disease, the result of pulmonary congestion following grip. He had been ill for two weeks. His heart weakness had already given rise
                                                        to anxiety, which was greatly accentuated yesterday. He died in his country villa, about thirty miles from Moscow, at the age of 68.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Gorky had become one of the most popular figures in the U.S.S.R. in recent years as he gradually passed from a sympathizer to one of the warmest supporters of the Soviet regime. He played a leading role at the International Writers Congress in Moscow
                                                        in the Summer of 1934. His photograph in the congress hall was nearly as large as Stalin&apos;s.

                                                        Although he did not participate in politics directly and was not a member of the Bolshevist party, he championed the Soviet cause unequivocally. Tverskaya Street, one of the leading thoroughfares of Moscow, was named Gorky Street in his honor.

                                                        Maxim Gorky&apos;s return to Russia in 1928 was something in the nature of a triumphant parade. Honors--more honors than for any other man in Soviet Russia--were showered upon the author. The ancient city of Nizhni Novgorod lost its old name and was called
                                                        Gorky in 1932. The largest airplane in the world at the time was named after the author of &quot;Chelkash.&quot; It was wrecked in 1935. The main literary institute in the U.S.S.R. has been called
                                                        the Maxim Gorky Institute.

                                                        of the Russian people has been enormous, the new school of Soviet writers has rebelled to a certain extent against his somewhat ponderous writings of later years. His fame, at the turn of the century,
                                                        was international. In later years he has been more of a semi-political figure in Soviet Russia.

Abandoned by His Parents</b></p>

The lot of the nomad, which he immortalized in later years, appeared to be his destiny. Desperate struggles with
                                                        cold and hunger, neglect and misery were his lot from his earliest days. He was compelled to leave school when he was taken down with cholera and he never returned. His father contracted the same
                                                        illness and died, and upon Gorky&apos;s recovery he found that his mother had died of consumption. The grandparent informed his convalescent boy that he had lost his hoarded wealth and that he must

                                                        Tramping about the Volga region, he chanced upon Captain Mikail Samouir, an old seafaring man, who liked the bright and companionable vagabond. The captain, an educated man, offered to teach the youth to read, but at first Gorky hated books, and it took
                                                        him a long time to acquire an appreciation of the beauties stored in the books the captain offered him. At first he read the Bible, then the Arabian Nights, and at length became fascinated with the
                                                        works of the Russian masters of the day. When he realized how ignorant he was he sought an education.

                                                        He had read somewhere that Leo Tolstoy got his education at the University of Kazan, so, at the age of 15, he bade the captain good-bye and set out for Kazan. He was destined to disappointment at the end of his journey, for, to his chagrin, he learned
                                                        for the first time that an education such as he desired had to be bought. He therefore went to work in a bakeshop, earning the sum of 3 rubles per month--$1.50 in the coin of the United States.

Immortalizes Dingy Bakeshop</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In his short story &quot;Twenty-one and One Other,&quot; he immortalized the miserable and dingy bakeshop, with its ceaselessly toiling bakers and fiery tongues leaping from the bake oven. Fantastic pictures set his imagination aglow, for he had heard
                                                        of the city of Tiflis, with its semi-barbaric inhabitants. He left the bakeshop bound for the Crimea, but apparently on this attempt he did not get far. A stranger stopped him as he lounged about
                                                        the university preparatory to taking his departure. The man was a lawyer, who, after hearing the story of the impetuous boy, offered him employment. Gorky became a clerk in the law office, and then
                                                        followed long days of hard study.

                                                        Finally he parted from his benefactor and arrived in Tiflis in 1892, where he found employment in a railroad shop. There he wrote his first short story, but his best work in this line was not done until some years later, when he met Vladimir Korolenko,
                                                        the famous Russian short-story writer. Unlike most Russian writers, Gorky was received with great enthusiasm. He found an echo within the hearts of the multitude. All over the world his work began
                                                        to meet with approval, as it was translated into many languages.

His favorite type, however, was
                                                        the man in revolt against society. Through his years of association with that class he wrote from personal knowledge and easily enlisted the sympathy of his readers. He also produced some plays with
                                                        high ideals, such as &quot;At the Lowest Depths,&quot; which met with great success in Moscow.

An Exile for Eight Years</b></p>

                                                        While Gorky cultivated the art of expressing revolutionary ideas in his books without actually giving the censor an excuse to suppress them, he fell into disastrous conflict with the authorities when, later, he engaged actively in socialistic anti-government
                                                        propaganda. Several times he was cast into prison because of his seditious utterances, and after incarceration at Riga in January, 1905, he virtually became an exile for eight years.

                                                        He came to America in the Spring of 1906. When it was learned that the &quot;Mme. Gorky&quot; with whom he was travelling was in reality Mlle. Andreieva, an actress, and not legally married to the revolutionist, a revulsion of sentiment set in and society
                                                        refused to have anything more to do with him, despite the explanation that under the Russian laws it had been impossible to obtain a divorce from his wife, with whom he had not lived for years. Admission
                                                        to New York hotels was refused him, and, finally, after a period of seclusion, he left America, bitterly denouncing the country. In 1907, while living in the shadow of death from tuberculosis at
                                                        Capri, Italy, Gorky married the actress.

In 1914, however, he returned to Russia. Soon thereafter the World War started. Although 46 years old, with health undermined, and a supposedly confirmed
                                                        pacifist, Gorky enlisted in the Russian Army as a private and served at the front in Galicia. He said a European disaster would be brought about if Germany won the war, and he was willing to sacrifice
                                                        his principles to avert such a catastrophe.

                                                        When the revolution broke out in 1917 Gorky was as ardent a revolutionist as any, and was active in politics as editor of his revived organ, Svobodnaia Zhizn (Free Life), which had been previously suppressed because of its revolutionary tendencies. When
                                                        Kerensky was overthrown, Gorky found himself in bitter disagreement with the Bolsheviki and attacked them almost daily in editorials and bulletins issued over his name. His opposition did not last
                                                        long, however, and he was soon won over to the Bolshevist cause.

                                                        His adherence to the Soviet cause was questioned at various times, due to temporary quarrels with the powers that be, but, generally speaking, he never wavered in his support of the principles for which the Bolsheviki stood. In 1918 he was appointed chief
                                                        of the Soviet Bureau of Propaganda, and early the next year he was elected a member of the Petrograd Soviet. His wife became an official of the Department of Education.

                                                        As a matter of fact, Gorky was to show himself by his later actions and statements to be heartily in accord with Soviet principles. When the tenth anniversary of the Bolshevist regime was celebrated, Gorky sent a letter of greeting to the Soviet Government.

                                                        While in Russia Gorky abandoned his literary work, only to take it up again when he was abroad. For a year or two after leaving Russia he was believed to be slowly dying of his tubercular trouble, but, after purchasing a villa in Sorrento, Italy, and
                                                        taking up his residence there, he recovered his health completely. His most important literary work, composed at Sorrento, was his autobiography, written in the form of a diary, but he also wrote
                                                        several novels and plays, considered by critics to be as fine as any of his early work. On his sixtieth birthday, which occurred in March, 1928, the Soviet Government honored him by issuing a special
                                                        set of postage stamps bearing his portrait. Gorky was the first writer so honored in Russia.
