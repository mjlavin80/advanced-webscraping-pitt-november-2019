                                                        The Duke defied the British Establishment to marry Mrs. Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson, a twice-divorced American.

                                                        room of the house overlooking the Bois de Boulogne.

                                                        the Duke was reported to be &quot;in need of a long rest.&quot;

                                                        With these words, delivered with sadness over the radio on Dec. 11, 1936, to his subjects in Britain, Edward VIII, later the Duke of Windsor, became the first monarch in British history to voluntarily abdicate his throne, which he did 11 months after

                                                    <p>A popular king, Edward VIII touched off a sensation at home and abroad with the announcement that he intended to leave the throne to marry Mrs. Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson, an American who had been
                                                        twice divorced.</p>

                                                    <p>Edward had been determined to marry Mrs. Simpson, although Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin had tried to dissuade him, on the ground that the King, as head of the Church of England, would be violating
                                                        the church&apos;s doctrines against divorce.</p>

                                                        In the absence of legislation that would permit the marriage, King Edward chose to abdicate. He was succeeded by his brother, the Duke of York, who became King George VI. The new King made his predecessor the Duke of Windsor.
                                                    </p>

Then, on Dec. 12, at 2 A.M., he left England. He married Mrs. Simpson six months later in France.

                                                        while he was in London for eye operations.</p>

                                                    <p>Much of the time in recent years was spent at their home in the Bois du Boulogne on the edge of Paris, where the Duke enjoyed gardening and occasionally received visitors, including Emperor Hirohito
                                                        of Japan on his world tour last year.</p>

                                                        Edward was born on June 23, 1894, in the 57th year of the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His mother was the former Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, later to be Queen Mary, and his father was the Duke of York, later to become King George
                                                        V.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He was christened Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David of the House of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha. In 1917, George V renounced the German name and proclaimed it the House of Windsor.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Edward--whom the royal family referred to by his last given name, David--spent much of his childhood at Sandringham in Norfolk, in a household where his father insisted on stern discipline. &quot;I have
                                                        often thought,&quot; the Duke later wrote, &quot;that my father liked children only in the abstract.&quot;</p>
                                                    <b>Served in France</b>
                                                    <p>In 1907, Edward entered the Royal Naval College at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, where the discipline was rigorous. With the death of his grandfather, Edward VII, in 1910, and the ascension of George
                                                        V, Edward became heir apparent and was sent to Magdalen College at Oxford for a broader education.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Edward did not excel in academics, but he enjoyed college life, engaging in such extracurricular pursuits as dancing and playing the banjo.</p>
                                                    <p>When World War I began, he was transferred to the Grenadier Guards. As a result of his own persistence he was eventually sent to France, where he served on the staff of the commander of the British Expeditionary
                                                        Force. He was never permitted on the front lines for long, but was under fire several times.</p>
                                                    <p>After the war, the Prince of Wales took a series of royal tours around the world that attracted great attention. He was accorded a particularly thunderous welcome in New York in 1919, and newspapers
                                                        carried headlines stressing his eligibility as a bachelor.</p>
                                                    <p>The Prince&apos;s genuine friendliness, which allowed him to mingle with people, combined with a somewhat shy, almost wistful manner, convinced those who saw him that he would be a popular king.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In 1930 the Prince met Mrs. Ernest Simpson, wife of an American maritime broker. Mrs. Simpson&apos;s first marriage, to E. Winfield Spencer, had ended in divorce.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;In character,&quot; the Duke later wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Wallis was, and still remains, complex and elusive, and from the first I looked upon her as the most independent woman I had ever
                                                        met. This refreshing trait I was inclined to put down as one of the happier outcomes of the events of 1776.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>About the time that the Prince of Wales decided that he wanted to marry Mrs. Simpson, his father, George V, died, on Jan. 20, 1936. Two days later, Edward VIII was proclaimed King. In his 11 months on
                                                        the throne, Edward made it clear through his personal style that his would be an unorthodox approach to the monarchy.</p>
                                                    <p>But as it became clear that a marriage to Mrs. Simpson, who had received a preliminary divorce decree that October, could not be accommodated with his own position, Edward VIII decided to abdicate before
                                                        his coronation. The marriage took place June 3, 1937, at the Chateau de Cande at Monts, near Tours, France.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;I did not value the crown so lightly that I gave it away hastily,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I valued it so deeply that I surrendered it, rather than risk any impairment of its prestige.&quot;</p>

                                                        the church&apos;s doctrines against divorce.</p>

Then, on Dec. 12, at 2 A.M., he left England. He married Mrs. Simpson six months later in France.

                                                        of Japan on his world tour last year.</p>

His mother was the former Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, later to be Queen Mary, and his father was the Duke of York, later to become King George

                                                    <p>He was christened Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David of the House of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha. In 1917, George V renounced the German name and proclaimed it the House of Windsor.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Edward--whom the royal family referred to by his last given name, David--spent much of his childhood at Sandringham in Norfolk, in a household where his father insisted on stern discipline. &quot;I have
                                                        often thought,&quot; the Duke later wrote, &quot;that my father liked children only in the abstract.&quot;</p>
                                                    <b>Served in France</b>
                                                    <p>In 1907, Edward entered the Royal Naval College at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, where the discipline was rigorous. With the death of his grandfather, Edward VII, in 1910, and the ascension of George
                                                        V, Edward became heir apparent and was sent to Magdalen College at Oxford for a broader education.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Edward did not excel in academics, but he enjoyed college life, engaging in such extracurricular pursuits as dancing and playing the banjo.</p>
                                                    <p>When World War I began, he was transferred to the Grenadier Guards. As a result of his own persistence he was eventually sent to France, where he served on the staff of the commander of the British Expeditionary
                                                        Force. He was never permitted on the front lines for long, but was under fire several times.</p>
                                                    <p>After the war, the Prince of Wales took a series of royal tours around the world that attracted great attention. He was accorded a particularly thunderous welcome in New York in 1919, and newspapers
                                                        carried headlines stressing his eligibility as a bachelor.</p>
                                                    <p>The Prince&apos;s genuine friendliness, which allowed him to mingle with people, combined with a somewhat shy, almost wistful manner, convinced those who saw him that he would be a popular king.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In 1930 the Prince met Mrs. Ernest Simpson, wife of an American maritime broker. Mrs. Simpson&apos;s first marriage, to E. Winfield Spencer, had ended in divorce.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;In character,&quot; the Duke later wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Wallis was, and still remains, complex and elusive, and from the first I looked upon her as the most independent woman I had ever
                                                        met. This refreshing trait I was inclined to put down as one of the happier outcomes of the events of 1776.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>About the time that the Prince of Wales decided that he wanted to marry Mrs. Simpson, his father, George V, died, on Jan. 20, 1936. Two days later, Edward VIII was proclaimed King. In his 11 months on
                                                        the throne, Edward made it clear through his personal style that his would be an unorthodox approach to the monarchy.</p>
                                                    <p>But as it became clear that a marriage to Mrs. Simpson, who had received a preliminary divorce decree that October, could not be accommodated with his own position, Edward VIII decided to abdicate before
                                                        his coronation. The marriage took place June 3, 1937, at the Chateau de Cande at Monts, near Tours, France.</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;I did not value the crown so lightly that I gave it away hastily,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I valued it so deeply that I surrendered it, rather than risk any impairment of its prestige.&quot;</p>
