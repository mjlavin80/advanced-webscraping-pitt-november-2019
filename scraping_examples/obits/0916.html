Hill the greatest constructive genius of the Northwest is gone,&quot; Governor Burnquist said. &quot;He was acknowledged as its foremost railroad builder and business man, but his unparalleled ability appeared in many
                                                        other fields of endeavor. He was ever greatly interested in agriculture, art, and education. His great and numerous gifts, especially to his city and to various institutions of learning, show his
                                                        philanthropic spirit. The loss which his city, his State, and nation have sustained through his death cannot be measured.&quot;

His mother was Scottish, and Mr. Hill inherited the best traits of both races. His early education was

                                                        leaving his horse tied at the gate. The boy saw that the animal was tired and carried it a pail of water. The stranger was pleased at his thoughtfulness, and as he rode off tossed him a newspaper
                                                        from the United States and called out gravely, &quot;Go there, young man. That country needs youngsters of your spirit.&quot;

Gets Work on River Front

                                                        Then he started on his travels, which led from Maine to Minnesota, during which he was always investigating and observing--always looking for the chance that he felt would come to him. It was in 1856 that he disembarked from a Mississippi River packet
                                                        at St. Paul, then a frontier town of about 5,000 inhabitants. After looking the town over, young Hill decided to go to work and obtained a job as stevedore and clerk with W.J. Bass &amp; Co., agents

                                                        St. Paul was then having its first experience with railroad building and was meeting with poor success. Eighty miles of road had been laid to St. Cloud, 316 miles to Breckenridge. In addition, there were 100 miles built into space which were said to begin
                                                        and end nowhere. This railroad venture finally collapsed with a deb of $33,000,000, its only assets being &quot;a few streaks of rust and a right of way.&quot; In addition it had earned the ill-will
                                                        of all those connected with it.</p>

He felt a consuming desire to acquire it. Success had been the result of his hard work and foresight so far, and he began to make definite
                                                        plans for getting hold of those dead railroads. For five years he dickered, those who knew his hopes regarding him as a visionary, and then he made the final decision and acted. He sold all his other
                                                        interests, receiving $100,000 for them, and, in partnership with Donald A. Smith, afterward Lord Strathcona, George Stephen, afterward Lord Mountstephen, and John S. Kennedy, the New York banker,
                                                        obtained the property he desired.

Becomes Railroad Manager
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This was the birth of the St. Paul, Minnesota &amp; Manitoba Railway, which was formed to operate the property, with Mr. Hill as General Manager and chief of practically all operations. This was in 1878, and four years later he became Vice President,
                                                        being elected President the following year. As chief executive he held the power to realize his dreams of a great transportation system, and he undertook to extend the road to the Pacific Ocean.
                                                        Again the skeptics regarded his plans as impossible of successful completion, and the extension became known as &quot;Hill&apos;s Folly.&quot; It was thought that it would be utterly impractical
                                                        for his system to live in the face of the competition it was forced to meet. There were three great systems to the south, all of which received large Government bonuses, whereas the &quot;Manitoba,&quot;
                                                        or the &quot;Great Northern,&quot; as it soon came to be known, did not have a dollar of Government subsidy or the grant of an acre of land to help it in its progress from the Minnesota boundary
                                                        to the sea. Those who considered these facts failed to remember that the line had &quot;Jim&quot; Hill, as he was known, back of it. With his indomitable energy and grim determination the Great Northern
                                                        had more behind it than all the Government land grants and subsidies the other roads had leaned on.
                                                    </p>

                                                        Critics said that he was building through a country barren of people, which could give his line no tonnage and would mean ruin. But they reckoned without the genius of the empire builder. He laid rails westward at the rate of a mile a day, and at an average
                                                        cost of $30,000 a mile, and as he went he left a trail of embryonic farms and homesteads by the railside. Thus was the foundation laid for the coming empire.

                                                        Then came the completion of the line to Puget Sound, and the empire builder turned his genius to building up the land that must support his road. Knowing that there was quick money in beef and hogs, he introduced the livestock industry into vast areas
                                                        of bunch-grass plains and improved the breeds of stock by importing the best blood that money could buy. He turned to farming and sent demonstration trains through the country with experts who showed
                                                        the people how to grow more wheat to the acre, and then to market this grain, he made a cheap rate by railroad and steamship to Buffalo, where it was handled in the great elevators he built.

                                                        For twenty years Mr. Hill left nothing undone to develop his empire and to make it bring tonnage to &quot;Hill&apos;s Folly,&quot; the Great Northern. During these years he came to be regarded as a sort of father by his people. They came and took up the
                                                        land and thriving towns grew up almost before the weeds had grown on the railroad cuts and embankments. All through four States the name of Hill swayed the destinies of men, and there seemed to be
                                                        nothing that could happen unless he was directly or indirectly responsible for its successful conclusion. The term &quot;Hill&apos;s Folly&quot; gradually changed to &quot;Hill&apos;s Fortune&quot;--his
                                                        courage, foresight and will power had won.

                                                        With his fast-growing empire behind him, he stood at the Pacific tidewater, and the Orient beckoned to him. He saw the golden opportunities that awaited him there, and he organized a fleet of Pacific steamships for the commercial invasion of China and
                                                        Japan. Japan, then in the first flush of her recent growth, wanted steel rails, but proposed getting them from England, as the rates were less. It is said that John W. Gates, the Chicago steel magnate,
                                                        came to Mr. Hill with the proposition of getting American rails to China, and the railroad man replied: &quot;I will make you a rate of $8 a ton from Chicago or Pittsburgh to Yokohama. If that is
                                                        too much, I will carry it for the axle grease used on the locomotives and freight cars; if you can&apos;t stand that, I will carry your freight for nothing!&quot;

                                                        Mr. Hill&apos;s great passion for empire building conflicted with another great passion for railroad domain, and there ensued the great stock market fight for the control of the Northern Pacific, with its memorable &quot;Blue Thursday,&quot; May 9, 1901,
                                                        the story of which is still told in Wall Street. E.H. Harriman and his associates had then developed the Union Pacific system and had formed a close alliance with the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St.
                                                        Paul. Mr. Hill&apos;s roads lacked a Chicago outlet. Together with the late J.P. Morgan, Mr. Hill first endeavored to secure the St. Paul. That road was not for sale. They then bought control of
                                                        the Burlington and turned it over to the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. Mr. Harriman and Jacob H. Schiff met this move by starting after the Northern Pacific in the open market, and so well
                                                        conducted their campaign that they had all but control of the property before the Hill-Morgan crowd learned of the fight against them.

Brokers acting for both sides bid the stock up until on the day of the corner it sold at $1,000 a share, while panic
                                                        seized the Stock Exchange and the rest of the market broke widely, sweeping away an estimated $1,000,000,000 of market values. If all of the Northern Pacific stock that had been contracted for on
                                                        the Exchange could have been delivered, it turned out, each party would have had a majority. But delivery was impossible, and a compromise was reached in which shorts were permitted to settle.

                                                        Following the settlement of the struggle in the stock market, the count of stock showed the Harriman party in possession of the majority of Northern Pacific common and preferred combined. But Mr. Hill and his associates had a majority of the common, and,
                                                        being in control of the company, were in a position, under its charter, to retire the preferred stock. Thus the upshot was not far from a drawn battle, and there was evolved, by way of peace terms,
                                                        the Northern Securities Company, to which were turned over the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, carrying the control of the Burlington, held by both parties. The United States Supreme Court subsequently
                                                        dissolved the holding company, but in so doing ordered its shares distributed pro rata, much to Mr. Harriman&apos;s disappointment, and the control of the three roads reverted to Mr. Hill and his
                                                        associates.

                                                        imposing figure of a man. And the head--shaggy brows, shading an eye that bored right through; a mass of long, iron-gray hair reaching to the collar of his coat, and a heavy, rough, iron-gray beard,
                                                        growing without restraint over the entire face, yet hiding nothing of the immense chin and powerful jaws, and the wide lips, between which showed two rows of teeth seemingly fit to crunch iron.

So huge were his interests there that he testified before the Stanley

His son, Louis W. Hill, succeeded

                                                        with them over the transaction. He said that it would prove to be a help to this country, but expressed regret that his presence here forced him to forego his birthday celebration at home.

When he was a station agent near St. Paul he boarded at the Merchants&apos; Hotel, where Mary Mehegan served his meals to him. He lost his heart to her and won

                                                        happy, and they were never more joyful than when surrounded by their three sons and six daughters in the St. Paul home.

                                                        Mr. Hill always insisted that there was no secret in his great success. He had no new receipts for success to offer, and said: &quot;The man with the big opportunity today is the man in the ranks.&quot; Extravagance, he insisted, was often the cause of
                                                        failure. Mr. Hill regarded this as a national tendency, against which he strongly set himself, particularly when it concerns the natural resources of the United States.

                                                        for their hero. He ruled his road and people almost like a dictator. The route of the road, and the locations of its settlements, were all decided by him, whether others liked it or not, as part
                                                        of his economic policy. Branch lines of his road were built with singular regularity, always providing a minimum of short lines on which light trains were necessary.

His Interest in Art
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was said that Mr. Hill was gifted with fine tastes and a keen artistic sense of beauty of form and color, and his collections of art and jewels were among the finest in the country. From the earliest days of his prosperity he spent money in indulging
                                                        what might be called his secret passion for gems of the rarest. None of these were ever used for personal adornment by either their owner or his family, except on the rarest occasions. His pleasure
                                                        in them was that of the collector.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His knowledge of precious stones was that of an expert, and several years ago it was said his collection was worth more than $2,000,000. One of his delights, in his hours of leisure, was to take out his collection and show it to his friends, explaining
                                                        the distinctive points of each stone.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        From precious stones, his first love, he turned to art. When he built his great home on Summit Avenue, in St. Paul, one of his chief features was the picture gallery, two hundred feet long, and running from one end to the other of the residence. It is
                                                        finished in oak, with a large pipe organ at one end and a great fireplace at the other, over which hangs Ribot&apos;s &quot;Christ Taken from the Cross.&quot; Mr. Hill was his own agent in the selection
                                                        and purchase of his works of art, and it was said that he could not be deceived by spurious works or copies, and seldom failed to discern the true value of a picture.

                                                    <p>
                                                        It was not generally known that he was a fair artist himself. He would take his brushes and palette, and with a keen sense of the values of light, shade, coloring and perspective, would turn out a very fair painting. When he was a boy in the Quaker school
                                                        in Rockwood, Canada, he used to draw and make copies of famous engravings and paintings.

                                                    <p>
                                                        His picture gallery was said to be a paradise for art lovers. There are eighteen examples of the best work of Corot, which critics say cannot be matched in the world, not even in the Louvre. Among the best examples of this artist&apos;s work are his &quot;Bibils.&quot;
                                                        There are also splendid works by Fromentin, Decamp, Puvis de Chavannes, Millet, Troyon, Bouguereau, Banvin, Cazin, Henner, Laurens, Jules Breton, Daubigny, Dupre, Delacroix and Diaz. No estimate
                                                        of the value of his collection has ever been given, but it is known that Mr. Hill Seldom paid less than $50,000 for a picture.

Gifts to Charity</b>

                                                        Mr. Hill was generous in his charities, and had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the worthy poor. When he gave up his old home in St. Paul and moved into the Summit Avenue mansion, he gave the old residence, complete in all its furnishings, to
                                                        the Little Sisters of the Poor. In addition to this gift he had always contributed largely to their work in St. Paul and the Northwest.

Mrs. Hill was always a devout Catholic, and they were married in a Catholic church by a priest. Mr. Hill also gave largely to other church organizations
                                                        and charitable societies.

He was a member of the Union, Metropolitan, Manhattan, Jekyl Island, Down Town and New York Yacht Clubs, and an honorary member of the Rocky Mountain
