He also executed decorative work and is best known for his work in glass. He devised new formulas for decorative designs in this medium know as &quot;Tiffany Favrile

                                                        the institution. Its purposes, as outlined by Mr. Tiffany, are &quot;art education, directed both to art appreciation and production within the scope of the industrial as well as the fine arts, and,
                                                        as one means toward these educational purposes, the establishment and maintenance of a museum to contain objects of art.&quot;

He built studios and luxurious living quarters and every Summer invited fifty artist, from all parts of the country to work there at his expense.
                                                        The twelfth annual exhibit of the work of members of the foundation at the American-Anderson Galleries represented the work of more than 300 artists. The 500 pieces exhibited included paintings,
                                                        sculpture, lithographs, metal work and jewelry.

His Art Much Discussed</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Tiffany was reckoned as one of the first exponents of modern art in the United States. His own painting, architectural designs and glass brought about much discussion. When recognition came to him, however, it was overwhelming. During his later years
                                                        he leaned rather toward the conservative in art, although he was greatly interested in the work of all members of the foundation, however modern.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        His own home anticipated by twenty years the modern trend in furniture. He had designed the house, grounds, furniture, carpets, textiles, silver and china. There are studios for painting and sculpture and workshops for metal jewelry design, all connected
                                                        with the house by a long, glass- covered passageway. He lived there alone, except for servants and two trained nurses.

                                                        Mr. Tiffany married Miss Mary Woodbridge Goddard on May 15, 1872. Two years after her death in 1884 he married Miss Louise Wakeman Knox, a daughter of the Rev. J. H. Mason Knox of Philadelphia, who died several years ago.

                                                        Cass Gilbert, president of the academy, headed the delegation. On the parchment was inscribed:

                                                        sculpture, lithographs, metal work and jewelry.

His Art Much Discussed</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Tiffany was reckoned as one of the first exponents of modern art in the United States. His own painting, architectural designs and glass brought about much discussion. When recognition came to him, however, it was overwhelming. During his later years
                                                        he leaned rather toward the conservative in art, although he was greatly interested in the work of all members of the foundation, however modern.

                                                        His own home anticipated by twenty years the modern trend in furniture. He had designed the house, grounds, furniture, carpets, textiles, silver and china. There are studios for painting and sculpture and workshops for metal jewelry design, all connected
                                                        with the house by a long, glass- covered passageway. He lived there alone, except for servants and two trained nurses.

                                                        Mr. Tiffany married Miss Mary Woodbridge Goddard on May 15, 1872. Two years after her death in 1884 he married Miss Louise Wakeman Knox, a daughter of the Rev. J. H. Mason Knox of Philadelphia, who died several years ago.

                                                        On Jan. 8, 1931, in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of his election to the National Academy of Design, members of the council of the organization called on him at his home to present to him an illuminated parchment extolling his services to art.
                                                        Cass Gilbert, president of the academy, headed the delegation. On the parchment was inscribed:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;The officers and council of the National Academy of Design send greetings to our fellow- member, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and congratulate him on his fifty years as an academician. During this time, inspired by a vision of the future, his creative
                                                        genius has opened new fields, added greater beauty to the world of art and brought much honor to his profession.
                                                    </p>

                                                        &quot;It also desires to express its appreciation for his help and encouragement to many workers in the arts who have taken advantage of his splendid generosity in founding the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation.&quot;
