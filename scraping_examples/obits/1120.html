                                                    <p>
                                                        In his brief but extraordinary political career, the 42-year-old, Massachusetts-born Robert Francis Kennedy was Attorney General of the United States under two Presidents and Senator from New York. In those high offices he exerted an enormous influence
                                                        on the nation&apos;s domestic and foreign affairs, first as the closest confidant of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and then, after Mr. Kennedy&apos;s assassination in 1963, as the immediate
                                                        heir to his New Frontier policies.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The Kennedy name, which John had made magical, devolved on Robert, enabling him to win a Senate seat from a state in which he had little or no previous association. The Kennedy aura also permitted him to campaign this year for the Democratic Presidential
                                                        nomination and to gain important victories in the preference primaries. Wherever he went he drew crowds by evoking, through his Boston accent, his gestures and his physical appearance, a remarkable
                                                        and nostalgic likeness to his elder brother.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        At the same time Mr. Kennedy called forth sharply opposed evaluations of himself. For those who found him charming, brilliant and sincerely devoted to the welfare of his country there were others who vehemently asserted that he was calculating, overly
                                                        ambitious and ruthless.

                                                        On the other hand, those who questioned his motives pointed out that his candidacy was posed only four days after the New Hampshire primary, in which Senator Eugene J. McCarthy had demonstrated the political vulnerability of President Johnson. Further,
                                                        Mr. Kennedy&apos;s critics said, he had declared only as recently as Jan. 30:

Moving through the sleazy back streets of Oakland, he repeatedly stopped traffic; for six blocks

                                                        The business community, according to Fortune, condemned Mr. Kennedy as immature and irresponsible. Business, it was said, was disquieted &quot;by the reputation for radicalism that he has developed.&quot;</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        To criticism he could respond with asperity or angry chilliness. To the fervor and adulation of his supporters he seemed curiously aloof, exhibiting neither pleasure nor fright. Those close to Mr. Kennedy noticed that his eyes rarely sparkled, but, instead,
                                                        were sad and withdrawn and that his manner, despite a grin, was unemotional.

He spoke in an even baritone; there were no crescendos and little outward expansiveness. His only gestures
                                                        were to chop the air with his right hand for emphasis or to brush back his shaggy forelock when it slipped down over his forehead.

For example, he recently asked a rally in Fort Wayne, Ind., whether the city would vote for him. Otherwise, he went on, he and Ethel and all of their children would

                                                        and we won&apos;t need to expand the place. I&apos;ll send some of them away to school--and I&apos;ll make one of them Attorney General.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Kennedy was an indefatigable campaigner, able to put in a 16-hour day of stress and tension and then sleep briefly before going through another equally strenuous day. Indeed, he seldom seemed to relax, whether he was campaigning or not, for he played
                                                        with as much concentration as he worked. He was, for instance, a vigorous touch football participant, a hardy skier, a pace-setting mountain climber and a swimmer who did not mind plunging into the

He often conceded that he was aggressive, explaining semihumorously:

                                                        Robert Kennedy was born Nov. 20, 1925, in Brookline, Mass., a fashionable suburb of Boston, the son of Joseph and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. His father, the son of poor South Boston parents, was then already amassing a fortune in the stock market and associated
                                                        speculative enterprises.

(Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, who served three terms in the House
                                                        of Representatives and was Mayor of Boston.</p>

Thus Robert passed his early years as the little brother, with two older brothers and five young sisters--Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia and Jean. &quot;He
                                                        was the smallest and thinnest, and we feared he might grow up puny and girlish,&quot; his mother recalled, adding: &quot;We soon realized there was no fear of that.&quot;

Moreover, Robert&apos;s father laid down strict rules of conduct: Never take second best; when the going gets tough, the tough get going; passivity is intolerable.

A classmate at Milton Academy, where he prepared for Harvard, said: &quot;It was much tougher in school for him than the others--socially, in

Deeply affected, Robert traveled to Washington on his own several months later and persuaded Secretary
                                                        of the Navy James Forrestal to assign him as a seaman to a destroyer newly named for his brother.

There his tenacity gained him a place as end on the football team, although he weighed only 160 pounds and stood 5 feet 9 inches tall. After graduation in 1948, he went
                                                        to law school at the University of Virginia, where he took his degree in 1951.

                                                        liberal.

                                                        After a dispute with Mr. Cohn over the committee staff, Mr. Kennedy resigned his post in mid-1953, but rejoined it in February, 1954, as counsel to the Democratic minority. The following year--after the Army-McCarthy hearings--he succeeded Mr. Cohn as
                                                        chief counsel and staff director when Senator John L. McClellan, Democrat of Arkansas, became committee chairman. In that post he pursued investigations into alleged Communist influence and helped
                                                        develop some of the conflict-of-interest cases involving personalities in the Eisenhower Administration. Senator McClellan liked him, for he was a persistent questioner of witnesses and a resolute
                                                        investigator.

                                                        One result was that the Senator chose Mr. Kennedy as chief counsel of the Senate Select committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field when it was organized in January, 1957. Mr. Kennedy immediately began a headline-making inquiry into
                                                        the affairs of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, then under the presidency of Dave Beck. Beck was later imprisoned for filing false income tax returns.

Accused of Antilabor Views

                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Kennedy&apos;s sharp questioning of Beck before the Senate Rackets Committee, as the McClellan group was generally known, drew down on him the accusation that he was antilabor at worst and unsympathetic to the working man at best. This charge was
                                                        compounded when he investigated James R. Hoffa, Beck&apos;s successor, in 1958.

                                                        Hoffa, who was eventually convicted and jailed for jury tampering and misuse of union funds, disliked Mr. Kennedy, calling him &quot;a young, dim-witted, curly-headed smart-aleck&quot; and &quot;a ruthless monster.&quot; Calm and polite as the committee&apos;s
                                                        counsel, Mr. Kennedy nevertheless did not conceal his disdain for Hoffa. His reaction to an involved and obscure answer was often a sarcastic and disbelieving: &quot;Oh.&quot;

Officials of other unions were also prosecuted by Mr. Kennedy, generating a
                                                        coolness of organized labor toward him that was still evident when he was campaigning for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1968. The attitude of the trade union hierarchy, however, did not
                                                        permeate to the rank and file, who generally voted for him.

                                                        &quot;Bobby kept his card file constantly replenished with information on every local leader, every county VIP, every &apos;bit&apos; player in every key town. And he bore down most heavily on the states where the primary battles looked hottest: New Hampshire,
                                                        Indiana, West Virginia and Wisconsin (already marked for the kill), Oregon and Nebraska.

[Michael] Di Salle of Ohio, who had hoped to run as a favorite-son candidate, was soon finding himself unremittingly pressured by Bobby
                                                        to endorse Jack Kennedy. The two little fighting words &apos;or else&apos; hung in the air. With a primary fight against the Kennedys--a fight he stood to lose--a distinct possibility, Di Salle finally
                                                        capitulated. &apos;The Kennedys play rough and they play for keeps,&apos; he later said.&quot;

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>

I don&apos;t try to antagonize people but somebody has to be able to say no. If people are not getting off their
                                                        behinds and working enough, how do you say that nicely? Every time you make a decision in this business you make somebody mad.&quot;

                                                        In the election campaign that followed, against Richard M. Nixon, the Republican candidate, Mr. Kennedy proved as drivingly perfectionist as he had been during the primary races. He traveled the country, tightening up the party organization, settling
                                                        squabbles and dismissing incompetents. He even silenced Frank Sinatra, the singer, and Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, whom he considered liabilities to his brother.

He was also responsible, according to Mr. Quirk&apos;s book, for John Kennedy&apos;s intervention in the Martin Luther King case. As Mr. Quirk related it, this is what happened:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;The Rev. Martin Luther King was arrested for staging a sit-in at a department store in Atlanta, and was forthwith sentenced to four months of hard labor in a Georgia penitentiary. This event occurred a scant week before the election.

Robert Kennedy was reluctant at first, saying, &quot;Everything I do will rub off on the President.&quot; He
                                                        was also sensitive to the likely charge that the appointment was nepotic.</p>

                                                        The assassination plunged Mr. Kennedy into a deep grief that amounted virtually to melancholy. His face was a mask; sadness enveloped his eyes; he seemed to have shrunk physically, and he often walked alone, his hands dug into his jacket pockets. And
                                                        for the remainder of his life he lived with thoughts of his dead brother never far from the surface of his mind. When Dr. King was assassinated earlier this year, Mr. Kennedy was speaking at a political
                                                        rally. Almost by reflex action he offered the family his condolences and remarked that he could understand their feeling of sudden loss because he himself had undergone a similar shock over his brother.</p>

For a time in 1964 there was speculation that he might be President Johnson&apos;s running mate that fall. Whatever hopes he had, however, were dispelled when Mr. Johnson ruled out all
                                                        Cabinet members as Vice- Presidential material. Displeased, Mr. Kennedy resigned to run for the Senate from New York; and, establishing residence, he put into operation the political structure he
                                                        had erected for his brother in 1960 and won the nomination without difficulty.

                                                        And to the charge of being sinister, he replied:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;I like to be involved in politics. I like to be involved in government. I&apos;ve been in politics all my life. I would like to remain in government. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s so sinister.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        He defeated Mr. Keating by 800,000 votes in a campaign that demonstrated the visceral appeal he had for voters. In the Senate (and a national figure in his own right) he forged a position slightly to the left of Mr. Johnson on the problems of the poor
                                                        and the cities. He also sought to develop moderately &quot;dovish&quot; views on the war in Vietnam, but his opposition to Mr. Johnson on this issue always remained cautious.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was so restrained, indeed, that he held back from contesting for the Presidential nomination of 1968 until after the New Hampshire primary on March 12 showed the extent of voter disaffection with the war.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Thereafter, however, he fought keenly for the nomination, winning major primaries in Indiana, Nebraska and California. </p>

                                                        Campaigning with him was his wife, the former Miss Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Conn., to whom he was married in 1950. Mrs. Kennedy is expecting their 11th child in January. </p>
