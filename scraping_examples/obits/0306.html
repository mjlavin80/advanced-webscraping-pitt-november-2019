Had Cherished Three Ambitions</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In a moment of whimsical autobiography some years back Ring Lardner explained that at various times in his life he had cherished three great ambitions. As a youth he wondered whether he would ever see enough baseball. Then, a little later and in a new
                                                        period, he wanted to write stories for the magazines--and have them printed. Finally, in a more recent phase, he worried about whether he would ever have a play produced. He was successful in each
                                                        of the three.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As a newspaper man and sporting reporter he saw all the baseball he liked--and, indeed, as he said afterward, more than that. But baseball led him into the field of magazines, and ultimately to the writing of the stories collected under such titles as
                                                        &quot;The Love Nest,&quot; &quot;How to Write Short Stories&quot; and all the rest. Then the stage followed as a matter of course. &quot;June Moon,&quot; on which he collaborated two seasons ago,
                                                        gave a happy proof of his abilities in that field.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1905 he closed the prelude to his career, for in that year he ceased keeping books for the gas company at Niles, Mich., and went to South Bend, Ind., to reporting and baseball. He had been born twenty years before, duly educated at the local high school
                                                        and then sent, for an attempt at the lore of the engineer, to the Armour Institute in Chicago. He &quot;had no more desire to be an engineer than to be a sheep herder,&quot; he said, and--his marks
                                                        proving it--the authorities suggested the gas company.

Started as Sporting Editor</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As he sat on his bookkeeper&apos;s stool his interest in baseball was getting stronger. Then his chance came. His brother, who also had deserted engineering for newspaper work, was the correspondent for a Sound Bend paper. He was a good one and the paper
                                                        liked his work so well that a man was sent to offer him a staff job. The emissary stopped at the gas plant to inquire when the elder Lardner might be found. He went no further. Ring Lardner explained
                                                        that the brother had &quot;a contract he can&apos;t get out of, but I would make you a good man.&quot; He was hired.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For two years he was sporting editor of The South Bend Times, a position that carried with it the dubious corollary of being the local team&apos;s official scorer. He saw plenty of baseball, and the arguments due all official scorers. Then, in 1907, the
                                                        world&apos;s series was played in Chicago, and Mr. Lardner, taking his vacation, went. He was introduced to Hugh Fullerton, the sports writer, who was the means of finding him a vacancy on the staff
                                                        of The Chicago Inter Ocean. In the Spring he went on the road with the White Sox. One ambition was realized.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For the next six years he wrote sports in Chicago, Boston and St. Louis. In 1911 he married Miss Ellis Abbott of Goshen, Ind., and he was just paying for the furniture when his Boston paper was swept away. He borrowed the money for a return to Chicago
                                                        from the owners of the Red Sox and the Braves. He paid them back, &quot;to their astonishment,&quot; as he later explained. In 1913 Hugh E. Keogh, whose sport column, called &quot;By Hek,&quot; was
                                                        considered the best thing of its kind in the country, died and Mr. Lardner was given the difficult task of filling it. At first twenty letters a day to The Tribune told him how he failed.

Ventured on Use of Dialogue</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was in an effort to turn out seven columns a week that Lardner hit upon the method which was to make him famous. In hotel lobbies, clubhouses, dugouts, he had been listening to talk among the ball players--using slang and singular nouns and plural
                                                        verbs mixed together. One day in an effort to fill out his piece he wrote a short dialogue supposedly between two players engaged in a Pullman car poker game. It was the mixture as noted above, with
                                                        shrewd touches of character and the natural speech of the lowbrow.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The innovation was favorable received. In the world&apos;s series he invented a left-handed pitcher of the Giants, who reported the games in the Lardner style. Fans began asking who the author was, and a friend, the late Charles E. Van Loan, advised him
                                                        to send some of his work to The Saturday Evening Post. He did so, and a check and a call for more came back. He was on his way to the fulfillment of the second ambition--and friend &quot;Al&quot;
                                                        was created to delight a nation.

                                                        For the next six years Lardner continued to fill his column on The Chicago Tribune and to write magazine stories. In 1919 he left the paper to join a newspaper syndicate and moved to Great Neck, L. I. In the period before coming East, he published a number
                                                        of books--&quot;Bib Ballads,&quot; 1915; &quot;You Know Me, Al,&quot; 1915; &quot;Gullible&apos;s Travels,&quot; 1917; &quot;Own Your Own Home,&quot; 1917; &quot;Treat &apos;Em Rough,&quot; 1918;
                                                        &quot;The Real Dope,&quot; 1918; &quot;My Four Weeks in France,&quot; 1918, and &quot;The Young Immigrants,&quot; 1919. Later came &quot;Symptoms of Being 35,&quot; &quot;The Big Town,&quot; &quot;How
                                                        to Write Short Stories,&quot; &quot;What of It?&quot; &quot;The Love Nest,&quot; &quot;The Story of a Wonder Man&quot; and &quot;Round Up.&quot;

He admitted that he moved for no other reason than to be near the headquarters of the theatre. His weekly sketch for the syndicate could be written in Chicago as easily as in New York. Morris
                                                        Gest, on a visit West, had &quot;gambled&quot; and had given him a five-year contract--but that impresario did not like Ring Lardner&apos;s plays. Other managers refused them, also.

And then, a year later, came the bounding &quot;June Moon,&quot; which was suggested to George S. Kaufman
                                                        and Mr. Lardner by one of the latter&apos;s short stories. He wrote the songs for it, also.

Back in 1922, in the Ziegfeld Follies of that year, was a Lardner baseball scene, with none other than Will Rogers as the veteran pitcher. A bit later in the season he was
                                                        represented in &quot;The 49ers,&quot; his contribution being an epic of three fishermen well out beyond the three-mile limit. There were several sketches by him in &quot;The Nine Fifteen Revue&quot;
                                                        of 1930, and a number of lyrics in &quot;Smiles&quot; of the same year.

In his grotesque tales of baseball players, so immediately and so deservedly successful, Lardner reports the common speech
                                                        not only with humor but with the utmost accuracy. His writings are a mine of authentic Americana; his service to etymology incomparable.&quot;

Last Spring a recurrence of the illness sent him to California, where he spent several months. He returned some

Had Cherished Three Ambitions</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In a moment of whimsical autobiography some years back Ring Lardner explained that at various times in his life he had cherished three great ambitions. As a youth he wondered whether he would ever see enough baseball. Then, a little later and in a new
                                                        period, he wanted to write stories for the magazines--and have them printed. Finally, in a more recent phase, he worried about whether he would ever have a play produced. He was successful in each
                                                        of the three.

                                                    <p>
                                                        As a newspaper man and sporting reporter he saw all the baseball he liked--and, indeed, as he said afterward, more than that. But baseball led him into the field of magazines, and ultimately to the writing of the stories collected under such titles as
                                                        &quot;The Love Nest,&quot; &quot;How to Write Short Stories&quot; and all the rest. Then the stage followed as a matter of course. &quot;June Moon,&quot; on which he collaborated two seasons ago,
                                                        gave a happy proof of his abilities in that field.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In 1905 he closed the prelude to his career, for in that year he ceased keeping books for the gas company at Niles, Mich., and went to South Bend, Ind., to reporting and baseball. He had been born twenty years before, duly educated at the local high school
                                                        and then sent, for an attempt at the lore of the engineer, to the Armour Institute in Chicago. He &quot;had no more desire to be an engineer than to be a sheep herder,&quot; he said, and--his marks
                                                        proving it--the authorities suggested the gas company.

Started as Sporting Editor</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        As he sat on his bookkeeper&apos;s stool his interest in baseball was getting stronger. Then his chance came. His brother, who also had deserted engineering for newspaper work, was the correspondent for a Sound Bend paper. He was a good one and the paper
                                                        liked his work so well that a man was sent to offer him a staff job. The emissary stopped at the gas plant to inquire when the elder Lardner might be found. He went no further. Ring Lardner explained
                                                        that the brother had &quot;a contract he can&apos;t get out of, but I would make you a good man.&quot; He was hired.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For two years he was sporting editor of The South Bend Times, a position that carried with it the dubious corollary of being the local team&apos;s official scorer. He saw plenty of baseball, and the arguments due all official scorers. Then, in 1907, the
                                                        world&apos;s series was played in Chicago, and Mr. Lardner, taking his vacation, went. He was introduced to Hugh Fullerton, the sports writer, who was the means of finding him a vacancy on the staff
                                                        of The Chicago Inter Ocean. In the Spring he went on the road with the White Sox. One ambition was realized.

                                                    <p>
                                                        For the next six years he wrote sports in Chicago, Boston and St. Louis. In 1911 he married Miss Ellis Abbott of Goshen, Ind., and he was just paying for the furniture when his Boston paper was swept away. He borrowed the money for a return to Chicago
                                                        from the owners of the Red Sox and the Braves. He paid them back, &quot;to their astonishment,&quot; as he later explained. In 1913 Hugh E. Keogh, whose sport column, called &quot;By Hek,&quot; was
                                                        considered the best thing of its kind in the country, died and Mr. Lardner was given the difficult task of filling it. At first twenty letters a day to The Tribune told him how he failed.

Ventured on Use of Dialogue</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        It was in an effort to turn out seven columns a week that Lardner hit upon the method which was to make him famous. In hotel lobbies, clubhouses, dugouts, he had been listening to talk among the ball players--using slang and singular nouns and plural
                                                        verbs mixed together. One day in an effort to fill out his piece he wrote a short dialogue supposedly between two players engaged in a Pullman car poker game. It was the mixture as noted above, with
                                                        shrewd touches of character and the natural speech of the lowbrow.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The innovation was favorable received. In the world&apos;s series he invented a left-handed pitcher of the Giants, who reported the games in the Lardner style. Fans began asking who the author was, and a friend, the late Charles E. Van Loan, advised him
                                                        to send some of his work to The Saturday Evening Post. He did so, and a check and a call for more came back. He was on his way to the fulfillment of the second ambition--and friend &quot;Al&quot;
                                                        was created to delight a nation.

                                                        For the next six years Lardner continued to fill his column on The Chicago Tribune and to write magazine stories. In 1919 he left the paper to join a newspaper syndicate and moved to Great Neck, L. I. In the period before coming East, he published a number
                                                        of books--&quot;Bib Ballads,&quot; 1915; &quot;You Know Me, Al,&quot; 1915; &quot;Gullible&apos;s Travels,&quot; 1917; &quot;Own Your Own Home,&quot; 1917; &quot;Treat &apos;Em Rough,&quot; 1918;

He admitted that he moved for no other reason than to be near the headquarters of the theatre. His weekly sketch for the syndicate could be written in Chicago as easily as in New York. Morris
                                                        Gest, on a visit West, had &quot;gambled&quot; and had given him a five-year contract--but that impresario did not like Ring Lardner&apos;s plays. Other managers refused them, also.

And then, a year later, came the bounding &quot;June Moon,&quot; which was suggested to George S. Kaufman
                                                        and Mr. Lardner by one of the latter&apos;s short stories. He wrote the songs for it, also.

Back in 1922, in the Ziegfeld Follies of that year, was a Lardner baseball scene, with none other than Will Rogers as the veteran pitcher. A bit later in the season he was
                                                        represented in &quot;The 49ers,&quot; his contribution being an epic of three fishermen well out beyond the three-mile limit. There were several sketches by him in &quot;The Nine Fifteen Revue&quot;
                                                        of 1930, and a number of lyrics in &quot;Smiles&quot; of the same year.

In his grotesque tales of baseball players, so immediately and so deservedly successful, Lardner reports the common speech
                                                        not only with humor but with the utmost accuracy. His writings are a mine of authentic Americana; his service to etymology incomparable.&quot;
