                                                    <p>
                                                        Carlos Montoya, a guitarist and composer who played an important role in transforming flamenco from a localized Spanish folk form into a style with an international following, died on Wednesday. He was 89 and lived in Wainscott, L.I. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The cause of death was heart failure, said his son Allan Montoya of Wainscott.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Montoya was among the first flamenco guitarists to free his instrument from its accompanimental role in dance and vocal performances. Before him, flamenco guitarists were able to show their virtuosity and improvisatory flair in brief solo spots within
                                                        ensemble programs, or in the ingenuity of their accompaniments. An exception was Mr. Montoya&apos;s uncle, Ramon Montoya, who is generally credited in guitar histories as the first to give full recitals
                                                        of solo flamenco guitar music. Following in his uncle&apos;s footsteps, but touring and recording far more widely, Mr. Montoya began giving solo recitals in the 1940&apos;s.</p>

Music in Many Forms 
</b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Montoya was a prolific composer and arranger, and an early crossover artist: in addition to flights of improvisation based on traditional flamenco forms, he recorded arrangements of &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; and other jazz and popular songs. He
                                                        never learned to read music, but he allowed others to notate and publish his pieces so that aspiring players could learn his techniques. </p>

                                                        He always pointed out, however, that the published scores were merely guidelines: he never abandoned the improvisatory tradition that lies at the heart of flamenco, an Andalusian Gypsy form in which the only givens are rhythmic and harmonic patterns that
                                                        evoke specific emotions.

He toured with the ensemble for three years, and then worked with several other dancers, including Vicente Escudero and La Teresina, with whom he toured the United
