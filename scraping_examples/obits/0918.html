                                                    <p> Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood&apos;s most memorable romantic movies of the 1930&apos;s and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital
                                                        in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.

                                                        A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as &apos;&apos;Anna Christie,&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Grand

                                                        and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.

                                                        The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her

                                                    <p> Garbo&apos;s career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called &apos;&apos;Two Faced Woman.&apos;&apos; She went into what was to be
                                                        temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen. </p>
                                                    <p> Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.

Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build

When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: &apos;&apos;When
                                                        people are watching, I&apos;m just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> Questioned about the screens, she said, &apos;&apos;If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.&apos;&apos;

                                                        career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in &apos;&apos;Queen Christina,&apos;&apos; but his career continued to wither. He drank
                                                        heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.

                                                    <p> The largely fictional &apos;&apos;Queen Christina&apos;&apos; provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face
                                                        as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.

                                                    <p> Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and
                                                        instructed her &apos;&apos;to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.&apos;&apos;

                                                        he said. &apos;&apos;I asked her why. She said, &apos;During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.&apos; I replied,
                                                        &apos;When I&apos;m directing a movie, I don&apos;t go out for a milkshake.&apos; Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.&apos;&apos;

</b>
                                                    <p> By the late 1930&apos;s Garbo&apos;s box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M&apos;s solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was &apos;&apos;Ninotchka,&apos;&apos; a brilliant satire
                                                        written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane
                                                        Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, &apos;&apos;Garbo Laughs.&apos;&apos;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Her second comedy was &apos;&apos;Two Faced Woman,&apos;&apos; a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures,
                                                        was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled &apos;&apos;A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,&apos;&apos; William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers
                                                        in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> In later years, Garbo called herself &apos;&apos;a wanderer&apos;&apos; and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40
                                                        years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits,
                                                        large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.

                                                    <p> The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther,
                                                        said, &apos;&apos;She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one&apos;s life.&apos;&apos;

                                                    <p> &apos;&apos;She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before
                                                        the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.&apos;&apos;
