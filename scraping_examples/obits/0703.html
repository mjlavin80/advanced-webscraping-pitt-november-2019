                                                        and two years later he was on tour as the star of &quot;Peck&apos;s Bad Boy,&quot; in which he played the title role.</p>
                                                    <p>Meanwhile his parents and sister were traveling about the country with various road companies. In 1890 the family came together, and for the next ten years were billed as &quot;the Four Cohans,&quot;
                                                        from Tony Pastor&apos;s in New York to the old Orpheum in San Francisco, except for rare intervals when they appeared separately. On one of these occasions, George M., at the age of 15, made his

                                                    <p>The Cohan and Harris partnership lasted for fifteen years, during which they produced more than fifty comedies, plays and revues, with and without music. At one time they controlled five theatres in
                                                        New York, including the George M. Cohan Theatre at Broadway and Forty-second Street, and one in Chicago. They split in 1920, each going along &quot;on his own,&quot; but came together again temporarily
                                                        in 1937 to produce a play called &quot;Fulton of Oak Falls,&quot; which Parker Fennelly wrote. Mr. Cohan revised it and acted in its title role.</p>
                                                    <p>In his heyday Mr. Cohan possessed an amazing energy. He would go on the road as the star of one play, take the cast of another with him, write a script late at night, and rehearse the second cast in
                                                        the morning. He did most of his writing, either on the road or at home in his Fifth Avenue apartment, between midnight and dawn. Sometimes, when not acting, he would take rooms in an Atlantic City
                                                        hotel to write a new play. He wrote with a pencil on yellow paper.</p>
                                                    <p>According to some of the critics, his greatest contribution to the theatre was in &quot;energizing the American stage.&quot; His plays were all action and speed. At first they were criticized for having
                                                        no &quot;ideas,&quot; a criticism which he voiced himself, but as he grew older his work came to have more intellectual content. His reputation as a playwright grew gradually from the time he dramatized
                                                        &quot;Seven Keys to Baldpate&quot; in 1913. The play offended some of the critics because of the unorthodox manner in which it baffled the audience, but it was a big hit, and its formula has been
                                                        successfully followed by many subsequent writers of mystery plays.</p>
                                                    <b>An Eccentric Dancer</b>
                                                    <p>The fast movement of his playwriting derived largely from his experiences as a &quot;song-and-dance man.&quot; He and his sister, Josie, were early exponents of eccentric dancing. They stepped high,
                                                        fast and lively, sometimes dancing right over the stage furniture. At first Josie was more in demand as an entertainer than her brother. There was a time when &quot;the Four Cohans&quot; act had
                                                        to be broken up because theatre managers were willing to pay Josie alone more than all four together.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In his playwriting Mr. Cohan used the fast tempo of his vaudeville days. One of his big hits, &quot;The Rise of Rosie O&apos;Reilly,&quot; was a continuous dance, the characters swaying, stepping and
                                                        posturing through their entrances, lines and exits.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>From old-time vaudeville he also brought to the legitimate theatre a keen sense of burlesque. His &quot;revues&quot; of 1916 and 1918 struck a new and fresh note in Broadway musical comedy with their
                                                        satire on people and events of the day. He was adept at taking old-fashioned melodramas, burlesquing them and transforming them into hilarious comedies, as he did with &quot;The Tavern.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He used the patriotic note whenever opportunity offered, and it was no accident that he happened to be the author of &quot;Over There.&quot; The tune, he said, popped into his head one day on the way
                                                        to his office, and the bugle-line refrain and most of the first verse had formed themselves in his head by the time he reached his desk.

                                                    <p>Joseph Tumulty, secretary to President Woodrow Wilson, sent him the following appreciation:</p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Dear George Cohan: The President considers your war song &apos;Over There&apos; a genuine inspiration to all American manhood.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        &quot;Over There&quot; sold more than 1,500,000 copies. Mr. Cohan received $25,000 for the mechanical instrument rights alone, which he gave to his mother, who distributed it among soldiers&apos; funds and civic charities.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He joined an all-star cast in 1918 which made a two-week tour in a war play called &quot;Out There.&quot; This grossed $600,000 for the Red Cross.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>During the 1919 actors&apos; strike Mr. Cohan, then one of the most active producer-manager-actors in the country, would not side with the actors, who were in the throes of forming Actors Equity Association.
                                                        After a bitter row, in which he took a leading part, he helped found the rival Actors&apos; Fidelity League. He became president of this association, long since dissolved. Even after Equity dominated
                                                        the situation he would not become a member, although after many years Equity actors were allowed to appear with him on the stage under an amnesty granted to some members of the league. At the time
                                                        of the strike he also resigned from the Lambs and the Friars. He closed all his shows in protest and retired for several years from the stage.</p>
                                                    <b>Star of &quot;Ah Wilderness!&quot;</b>
                                                    <p>As an actor in musical shows Mr. Cohan brought the same vivacity to his performance as he did to his playwriting. It was when he acted in a revival of his own play, &quot;The Song-and-Dance Man,&quot;
                                                        in 1930, that he described himself as &quot;just a song-and-dance man,&quot; but by that time everybody in the world of the theatre knew better. Incidentally, he wrote this play in tribute to his
                                                        father, the old trouper, and to the vaudeville stage he himself had known as a boy, and which in later life he said was the only theatrical life he ever really loved.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>It was as the star of &quot;Ah Wilderness!&quot; by Eugene O&apos;Neill, that Mr. Cohan gave his finest performance as a serious actor. Here &quot;the man who owned Broadway&quot; proved that he could
                                                        play with deep understanding and effect a role far removed from that garish thoroughfare or anything with which he had previously been associated. But he might not have accepted the part except that
                                                        Mr. O&apos;Neill&apos;s father, James O&apos;Neill, star of &quot;Monte Cristo,&quot; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and many other plays, had been a trouper in the same old days as his own father.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Cohan had little use for Hollywood. He resisted all efforts to get him into the films until 1915, when he signed a contract that resulted in three silent movies. He did not return to Hollywood until 1932, when he made his first &quot;talkie.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s my last one, too,&quot; he announced when he returned to New York. He had been treated none too sympathetically by Hollywood. Movie producers and employees, not recognizing his unique
                                                        position in the American theatre, had failed to make use of his genius. A gatekeeper had barred his automobile from the movie lot because he was &quot;not a star,&quot; and an obscure young sub-executive,
                                                        immersed in routine, had reproved him for submitting a manuscript in his familiar penciled writing on yellow paper. He felt lost, and was glad to be back on Broadway.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        But the movies, which eventually came to appreciate Shakespeare, though in its own good time, woke up to the devotion Mr. Cohan&apos;s public had for their idol nine years later. After talking about filming Mr. Cohan&apos;s life for a year, one studio
                                                        moved the project into the script-writing stage in the Spring of 1941, titling it &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy.&quot; Mr. Cohan, having facts pried from him by a Hollywood writer, was dubious but anxious
                                                        about the whole business.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Would anybody go to see it?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be connected with a box-office flop.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Tell you what, we&apos;ll give away dishes and make sure,&quot; the Hollywood man offered. Mr. Cohan was reassured, but he had a request--&quot;I&apos;d like to sit all by myself in a theatre and
                                                        see what it adds up to.&quot; After eight months, during which the veteran actor busied himself with plans for taking part in entertainments for soldiers and sailors, the private preview was held.
                                                        Cohan walked out of the theatre and into a telegraph office to send a message to the Hollywood writer. It read:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>&quot;Thanks, kid. Hope you don&apos;t run out of dishes. George M.&quot;</p>
                                                    <b><p>Proved a Box-Office Hit</p></b>
                                                    <p>For the privilege of attending the New York premiere at the Hollywood Theatre of the film, in which James Cagney played the part of Mr. Cohan, on May 20, 1942, a distinguished audience purchased $5,750,000
                                                        worth of war bonds. By Fall the picture had grossed more than $1,000,000. July 3, 1942, was observed as George M. Cohan Day in New York by proclamation of Mayor La Guardia. The film had its premiere
                                                        in London at the Warner Theatre on Oct. 15, 1942, and Britons bought &amp; #163;870,269 in war securities to attend.</p>
                                                    <p>For all the money he made, Mr. Cohan was always predominantly the artist rather than the business man. He had an office, but seldom went to it. He transacted much of his business from public telephone
                                                        booths, remarking that his office really was in his hat. He liked to mingle with the audience between the acts or after the show, or to sit up with cronies over a late meal and a drink in an after-theatre
                                                        restaurant off Broadway, talking about the current theatre. From these listenings and talkings, many new ideas for plays, as well as changes in plays already on the boards developed.</p>

                                                        At one time he was almost as well known as a baseball fan as he was as a theatrical man. He remained a fan to the end of his days, but finally gave up his practice of going to the game every day the Giants were in town.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He married twice. His first wife was Ethel Levey, who became his dancing partner with &quot;the Four Cohans&quot; after his sister Josie married. A daughter, Georgette, who became an actress, was born
                                                        to them. The marriage was dissolved in 1907, after which Miss Levey was prominent as a dancer in England. He married the second Mrs. Cohan on July 4, 1908. Their children were Mary Helen, Helen Frances
                                                        and George Michael Jr.</p>
