                                                    <p>Jerome Kern, the composer, died yesterday at 1:10 P.M. of a cerebral hemorrhage in Doctors Hospital. His age was 60. At the bedside were his wife, Eva Leale Kern; his daughter, Elizabeth Kern, former
                                                        wife of Artie Shaw, the bandleader, and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, producer and song writer, who was closely associated with Mr. Kern in his career. Shortly after Mr. Kern&apos;s death Irving Berlin called

                                                        Mr. Kern collapsed in front of 450 Park Avenue on Monday and was taken unconscious in an ambulance to City Hospital. On Wednesday he was transferred to Doctors Hospital. He had been in an oxygen tent the last three days.

                                                        The composer, who resided at 917 Whittier Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif., came to New York on Nov. 2 to be co-sponsor with Mr. Hammerstein of a new production of their celebrated musical play, &quot;Show Boat,&quot; for which he had completed a new song
                                                        shortly before he was stricken ill. The production is scheduled to open in the Ziegfield Theatre in January.

                                                        One of America&apos;s foremost composers of music for the theatre and screen, Mr. Kern was rated by critics with Victor Herbert in the field of musical theatre, and his &quot;Show Boat&quot; has been one of the high-water marks of the media. Tunes which
                                                        have become part of the native songbooks--like &quot;Ol&apos; Man River,&quot; &quot;Why Do I Love You?&quot;, &quot;They Didn&apos;t Believe Me&quot; and &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;--poured
                                                        from his keyboard with a regularity that was the envy and amazement of his contemporaries. During a period of forty years he was credited with a total of 104 stage and screen vehicles containing
                                                        his melodies. Fifteen of these were reported to have passed the 2,000,000 mark in record sales.

Strictly speaking, only once, with Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who wrote the lyrics for &quot;Show Boat,&quot; did he deliberately write a song hit outside of a show or screen play. That was &quot;The
                                                        Last Time I Saw Paris.&quot; He called himself a &quot;musical clothier--nothing more or less,&quot; and said: &quot;I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays.&quot; But critics
                                                        pointed out that he was a finished musician and was able to create elaborate effects of counterpoint and complex instrumental and vocal ensembles which gave his operettas real value.

He once told an admirer: &quot;The fact that the theatregoing public likes my music is no credit to me. There are many other composers who write better music that the public doesn&apos;t

He knows his Richard
                                                        Strauss, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Wagner, Berlioz et al.&quot; Of his &quot;Show Boat,&quot; the critic said: &quot;This is a score which, by reason of its melodic inspiration, its workmanship, its reflection
                                                        of period and environment, has already won the position of a classic of its kind. It was created by a singularly gifted man, who had mastered his business * * * and its success has been richly deserved.&quot;
                                                        Yet when the conductor Artur Rodzinski asked Mr. Kern for a symphonic arrangement the latter demurred at first on the ground that he wasn&apos;t sufficiently well equipped.

He spoke in sporadic outburst and had a tremendous amount of nervous energy. He was an avid collector of rare books, and at one time it was said that he was
                                                        better known in the bookshops than in the marts of the musical trade. When, in January, 1929, he disposed of his great collection because it had become too much of a responsibility, the library brought
                                                        $1,729,462. The next day he passed a bookshop, saw a rare volume and bought it--out of habit, he is supposed to have confessed.

His first association with music came through his mother, who taught him to play the piano. After the usual schooling, his family sent him abroad and
                                                        he studied composition in Germany and England. His first music job was with the Lyceum Music Publishing Company as a pianist and song-plugger at a salary of $7 a week. He also plugged sheet music
                                                        at a local department store. Later he took a job with T. B. Harms &amp; amp; Co., music publishers, and eventually became vice president. In 1910 he married Eva Leale in England, where he gained
                                                        his first real recognition.

                                                        in an Eiffel way above the average primitive hurdy-gurdy accompaniment of our present-day musical comedy?&quot;

He did the music for &quot;The Red Petticoat,&quot; in 1911, and from 1915 to 1918 did the scores for at least nineteen productions. &quot;Sally,&quot; in 1920, starred the late Marilyn

Story Behind &quot;Show Boat&quot;</b>

                                                        The idea for turning Edna Ferber&apos;s novel, &quot;Show Boat,&quot; into a musical is credited to Mr. Kern. The late Alexander Woollcott used to prove the composer&apos;s modesty by telling how Mr. Kern called him on the telephone one day after he had
                                                        read the book to ask how he could meet Miss Ferber. Mr. Woollcott said Miss Ferber probably would be honored to meet Mr. Kern. The meeting was arranged and subsequently Oscar Hammerstein 2d was assigned
                                                        to write the lyrics. The December night that &quot;Show Boat&quot; opened in 1927 speculators were said to have received as much as $100 for a pair of tickets. The show brought fame to the late Jules
                                                        Bledsoe, Negro baritone, who sang &quot;Ol&apos; Man River,&quot; the song that the composer considered his masterpiece. &quot;Show Boat&quot; was revived in 1932 with Paul Robeson after it had thrilled
                                                        London. Mr. Robeson also appeared in it in 1936, when it was produced in Hollywood.

Several of his Broadway successes, besides &quot;Show Boat,&quot; were filmed. One of more recent scores was for Deanna Durbin&apos;s &quot;Can&apos;t Help Singing.&quot; At his

                                                        set a precedent for Jerome Kern testimonials when he put on a birthday party for the composer over a national hookup. The week of Dec. 11-17, 1944, was set aside for a Jerome Kern Jubilee, of which
                                                        Paul Whiteman was chairman. During the period Mr. Kern&apos;s music was played throughout the nation.

                                                        shortly before he was stricken ill. The production is scheduled to open in the Ziegfield Theatre in January.

Known Best for &quot;Show Boat&quot;</b>

                                                        One of America&apos;s foremost composers of music for the theatre and screen, Mr. Kern was rated by critics with Victor Herbert in the field of musical theatre, and his &quot;Show Boat&quot; has been one of the high-water marks of the media. Tunes which

                                                        from his keyboard with a regularity that was the envy and amazement of his contemporaries. During a period of forty years he was credited with a total of 104 stage and screen vehicles containing
                                                        his melodies. Fifteen of these were reported to have passed the 2,000,000 mark in record sales.

Strictly speaking, only once, with Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who wrote the lyrics for &quot;Show Boat,&quot; did he deliberately write a song hit outside of a show or screen play. That was &quot;The
                                                        Last Time I Saw Paris.&quot; He called himself a &quot;musical clothier--nothing more or less,&quot; and said: &quot;I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays.&quot; But critics
                                                        pointed out that he was a finished musician and was able to create elaborate effects of counterpoint and complex instrumental and vocal ensembles which gave his operettas real value.

He once told an admirer: &quot;The fact that the theatregoing public likes my music is no credit to me. There are many other composers who write better music that the public doesn&apos;t

                                                        of period and environment, has already won the position of a classic of its kind. It was created by a singularly gifted man, who had mastered his business * * * and its success has been richly deserved.&quot;
                                                        Yet when the conductor Artur Rodzinski asked Mr. Kern for a symphonic arrangement the latter demurred at first on the ground that he wasn&apos;t sufficiently well equipped.

He spoke in sporadic outburst and had a tremendous amount of nervous energy. He was an avid collector of rare books, and at one time it was said that he was
                                                        better known in the bookshops than in the marts of the musical trade. When, in January, 1929, he disposed of his great collection because it had become too much of a responsibility, the library brought
                                                        $1,729,462. The next day he passed a bookshop, saw a rare volume and bought it--out of habit, he is supposed to have confessed.

His first association with music came through his mother, who taught him to play the piano. After the usual schooling, his family sent him abroad and
                                                        he studied composition in Germany and England. His first music job was with the Lyceum Music Publishing Company as a pianist and song-plugger at a salary of $7 a week. He also plugged sheet music
                                                        at a local department store. Later he took a job with T. B. Harms &amp; amp; Co., music publishers, and eventually became vice president. In 1910 he married Eva Leale in England, where he gained
                                                        his first real recognition.

                                                        in an Eiffel way above the average primitive hurdy-gurdy accompaniment of our present-day musical comedy?&quot;

Story Behind &quot;Show Boat&quot;</b>

                                                        The idea for turning Edna Ferber&apos;s novel, &quot;Show Boat,&quot; into a musical is credited to Mr. Kern. The late Alexander Woollcott used to prove the composer&apos;s modesty by telling how Mr. Kern called him on the telephone one day after he had
                                                        read the book to ask how he could meet Miss Ferber. Mr. Woollcott said Miss Ferber probably would be honored to meet Mr. Kern. The meeting was arranged and subsequently Oscar Hammerstein 2d was assigned
                                                        to write the lyrics. The December night that &quot;Show Boat&quot; opened in 1927 speculators were said to have received as much as $100 for a pair of tickets. The show brought fame to the late Jules
                                                        Bledsoe, Negro baritone, who sang &quot;Ol&apos; Man River,&quot; the song that the composer considered his masterpiece. &quot;Show Boat&quot; was revived in 1932 with Paul Robeson after it had thrilled
                                                        London. Mr. Robeson also appeared in it in 1936, when it was produced in Hollywood.

Several of his Broadway successes, besides &quot;Show Boat,&quot; were filmed. One of more recent scores was for Deanna Durbin&apos;s &quot;Can&apos;t Help Singing.&quot; At his

                                                        set a precedent for Jerome Kern testimonials when he put on a birthday party for the composer over a national hookup. The week of Dec. 11-17, 1944, was set aside for a Jerome Kern Jubilee, of which
                                                        Paul Whiteman was chairman. During the period Mr. Kern&apos;s music was played throughout the nation.
