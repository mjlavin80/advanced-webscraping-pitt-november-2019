                                                    <p>
                                                        Sammy Davis Jr., a versatile and dynamic singer, dancer and actor who overcame extraordinary obstacles to become a leading American entertainer, died of throat cancer yesterday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 64 years old and had been in deteriorating
                                                        health since his release from Cedar-Sinai Medical Center on March 13. </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The showman was born in a Harlem tenement, grew up in vaudeville from the age of 3 and never went to school. His talents as a mime, comedian, trumpet player, drummer, pianist and vibraphonist as well as singer and dancer were shaped from his childhood
                                                        and made him one of the nation&apos;s first black performers to gain mainstream acclaim. </p>

                                                        With heavy jewelry around his neck and on his fingers, and clad in a snug jumpsuit or tuxedo, the short, slim showman with a broken nose, defiant jaw and big, crooked smile had a rakish charm that energized stages for decades. He sold out leading nightclubs
                                                        and concert halls, won personal triumphs in such Broadway musicals as &apos;&apos;Mr. Wonderful&apos;&apos; (1956) and &apos;&apos;Golden Boy&apos;&apos; (1964), illumined movies and television and
                                                        made scores of hit recordings with such signature songs as &apos;&apos;What Kind of Fool Am I?,&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Candy Man,&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Mr. Bojangles&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;I&apos;ve

Slurs and Skepticism </b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The triumphs were punctuated by sometimes ugly controversies - abuse and slurs by whites, particularly over his marriage to a white actress, May Britt; resentment by blacks over what they viewed as his white life style, and widespread skepticism over
                                                        his mid-1950&apos;s conversion to Judaism.

                                                        Mr. Davis also endured major health setbacks. He lost his left eye in a near-fatal 1954 auto crash, had reconstructive hip surgery in 1985 that enabled him to dance again, and was told last year that he had throat cancer. He underwent eight weeks of radiation
                                                        treatments for a carcinoma growing behind his vocal cords, until his doctors said the cancer was in remission. He had smoked heavily for many years.

                                                        The debilitating illness and treatment prompted 26 of his fellow entertainers to salute his courage and longtime efforts to lower racial barriers in a two-and-a-half-hour television tribute on Feb. 4. The frail but indomitable Mr. Davis, whose voice was
                                                        only a husky whisper, did not speak, but he rose to do a brief soft-shoe step to a standing ovation.

                                                        Only a year earlier, he had announced his defeat of alcohol and cocaine. He completed a world tour with Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli (who filled in for an ailing Dean Martin) and publicized &apos;&apos;Why Me?,&apos;&apos; a book on which he had collaborated
                                                        with his friends Jane and Burt Boyar as a sequel to their best-selling 1965 Davis biography, &apos;&apos;Yes I Can.&apos;&apos;

                                                        The 1989 book said that John F. Kennedy had asked Mr. Davis and Miss Britt not to participate in the 1961 Presidential inauguration, lest the sight of an interracial couple anger Southerners. Mr. Davis also recounted the racism that haunted his life,
                                                        from bloody fights in the Army to being turned away from New York nightclubs.

His family was Baptist and until then he had thought little of religion, but he studied Judaism deeply, concluded &apos;&apos;it
                                                        teaches justice for everyone,&apos;&apos; and found &apos;&apos;an affinity&apos;&apos; between Jews and blacks, who have both &apos;&apos;been oppressed for centuries.&apos;&apos;

                                                        and Jeff. He had previously been married briefly to Loray White, a dancer. In 1970 he married Altovise Gore, also a dancer. </p>

The entertainer eschewed publicity while taking part in civil rights marches and contributing generously to humanitarian causes. His many awards included induction into the Hall of Fame of the National Association
                                                        for the Advancement of Colored People, honorary degrees from black colleges, and a Kennedy Center honor for career achievement.

He later renounced his backing, accusing Mr. Nixon of having made civil rights promises he did not keep. Looking back in 1987, Mr.
                                                        Davis affirmed that if the Kennedy Center salute to his career did not soften his rancor over the inaugural racial rebuff by President Kennedy, &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t know what does.&apos;&apos;

                                                        Sammy Davis Jr. was born to Sammy Davis and the former Elvira Sanchez on Dec. 8, 1925, in a Harlem tenement at 140th Street and Eighth Avenue. He was brought up by his father&apos;s mother, Rosa Davis, while his parents, both vaudevillians, were on tour.
                                                        In his third year, his mother left the act and also the family, and he joined the Orpheum circuit with his father and Will Mastin.

                                                        With typical zest, the youngster learned show business while his father got him occasional tutors to appease truant officers. As sound movies began to cripple vaudeville, the troupe shrank and eventually became &apos;&apos;The Will Mastin Trio, featuring
                                                        Sammy Davis Jr.&apos;&apos;

Performing in Army camps around the
                                                        country, he worked hard, he recalled, to reach the bigots, &apos;&apos;neutralize them and make them acknowledge&apos;&apos; him.

Gradually, as Mr. Davis honed his talents, the act became his showcase, with his father
                                                        and uncle providing tap and soft-shoe background.

One, in 1956, was the quasi-biographical &apos;&apos;Mr. Wonderful,&apos;&apos; which drew from Brooks Atkinson, drama critic of The New York Times, the observation that
                                                        the show &apos;&apos;comes alive only when young Mr. Davis rocks and rolls, tap-dances or does imitations.&apos;&apos;
