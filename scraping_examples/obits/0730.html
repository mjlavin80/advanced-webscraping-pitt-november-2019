                                                    <p>DETROIT, April 7--Henry Ford, noted automotive pioneer, died at 11:40 tonight at the age of 83. He had retired a little more than a year and a half ago from active direction of the great industrial empire
                                                        he founded in 1903.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        When he retired Mr. Ford was in excellent health, but turned over the management of the vast empire to his grandson. Henry Ford 2d, because, he said, he wanted to devote more time to personal interests.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Death came to the famed industrialist at his estate in Fairlane, in suburban Dearborn, not far from where he was born in 1863. At the Ford Company news bureau offices it was said that the exact cause
                                                        of death would not be known until Henry Ford 2d, his grandson, could reach the family home, perhaps within an hour.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Ford was reported to have been in excellent health when he returned only a week ago from his annual winter visit to the Ford estate in Georgia.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <p>Henry Ford was the founder of modern American industrial mass production methods, built on the assembly line and the belt conveyor system, which no less an authority than Marshal Josef Stalin testified
                                                        were the indispensable foundation for an Allied military victory in the Second World War.

                                                    <p>Mr. Ford had many other distinctions. As the founder and unchallenged master of an industrial empire with assets of more than a billion dollars, he was one of the richest men in the world. He was the
                                                        apostle of an economic philosophy of high wages and short hours that had immense repercussions on American thinking. He was a patron of American folkways and in later years acquired a reputation
                                                        as a shrewd, kindly sage. But these were all relatively minor compared with the revolutionary importance of his contribution to modern productive processes.

                                                        His career was one of the most astonishing in industrial history. Nearing the age of 40 he was looked upon as a failure by his acquaintances--as a day-dreaming mechanic who preferred to tinker with odd machines than to work steadily at a responsible job.
                                                        Yet within a dozen years he was internationally famous, and his Model T automobile was effecting changes in the American way of life of profound importance.

                                                        jeeps and amphibious jeeps, transport gliders, trucks, engines and much other equipment.

                                                        he had yielded to his son twenty-four years previously. He remained at its helm as it reached the peak of its gigantic war production, directing the war-expanded force of 190,000 workers.

                                                    <p>Mr. Ford was born on July 30, 1863, on a farm near Dearborn, nine miles west of Detroit. He was the eldest of six children. His mother died when he was 12 years of age. He went to school until he was
                                                        15. Throughout his schooldays he worked on the farm after school hours and during vacations.

                                                    <p>His mechanical bent first showed itself in an intense interest in the mechanism of watches. When he was 13 he took a watch apart and put it together again so that it would work. He had to do this work
                                                        secretly at night, after he had finished his chores on the farm, because his father wanted to discourage his mechanical ambitions. His tools were home-made and were limited to a screwdriver and a
                                                        pair of tweezers, fashioned respectively from a knitting needle and an old watch spring.

                                                    <p>In 1879, at the age of 16, he took the step that foreshadowed his remarkable career. He ran away from home. Walking all the way to Detroit, almost penniless, he went to work as an apprentice in a machine
                                                        shop. He did this in order to learn all he could of the making of machinery. He received $2.50 a week for ten hours a day, six days a week--a far cry from the wages paid in the Ford factories today.
                                                        As he had to pay $3.50 a week for board and lodging, he took another job, working from 7 to 11 o&apos;clock every night for a jeweler, for $2 more a week.

                                                        tractor with a one-cylinder engine, but was unable to devise a boiler light enough to make the tractor practicable. For several years he confined himself to cutting the timber on forty acres his
                                                        father had given him; operating a sawmill and repairing farm machinery for his neighbors.

                                                    <p>In 1890 he got a job as engineer and machinist with the Detroit Edison Company at $45 a month, and moved to Detroit. He set up a workshop in his backyard and continued his experiments after hours. He
                                                        completed his first &quot;gasoline buggy&quot; in 1892. It had a two-cylinder engine, which developed about four horsepower, and he drove it 1,000 miles. The first, and for a long time the only automobile

The company made and sold a few cars on his original model, but after two years Mr. Ford broke with his associates over a fundamental
                                                        question of policy. He already had envisioned the mass production of cars which could be sold in large quantities at small profits, while his backers were convinced that the automobile was a luxury,
                                                        to be produced in small quantities at large profits per unit.

                                                        developing eighty horsepower. The &quot;999,&quot; with the celebrated Barney Oldfield at its wheel, won every race in which it was entered.

                                                        majority control of this company. In 1919 he and his son, Edsel, became its sole owners, when they bought out the minority stockholders for $70,000,000.

                                                        After protracted litigation, Mr. Ford won the suit when the Supreme Court held that the Selden patent was invalid.</p>

                                                        his purpose. By chance one day, picking up the pieces of a French racing car that had been wrecked at Palm Beach, he discovered vanadium steel, which had not been manufactured in the United States

He concentrated on a single type of chassis, the celebrated Model T, and specified that &quot;any customer can have a car painted any color he wants, so long as it is black.&quot; On Oct. 1,
                                                        1908, he began the production of Model T, which sold for $850. The next year he sold 10,600 cars of this model. Cheap and reliable, the car had a tremendous success. In seven years he built and sold
                                                        1,000,000 Fords; by 1925 he was producing them at the rate of almost 2,000,000 a year.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He established two cardinal economic policies during this tremendous expansion: the continued cutting of the cost of the product as improved methods of production made it possible, and the payment of
                                                        higher wages to his employes. By 1926 the cost of the Model T had been cut to $310, although it was vastly superior to the 1908 model. In January, 1914, he established a minimum pay rate of $5 a
                                                        day for an eight-hour day, thereby creating a national sensation. Up to that time the average wage throughout his works had been $2.40 a nine-hour day.

                                                        level. The workers never had to stoop or move to get anything, and the speed at which they worked was controlled by the speed of the conveyor rather than the desires of the workmen.

                                                        during the war. The jury awarded him a verdict of 6 cents, but only after counsel for the defense had subjected him to a pitiless cross-examination which revealed him to be almost without knowledge

Refused Assistance of Bankers And Proved Resourcefulness

                                                    <p>The 1921 business depression brought the Ford Motor Company its most severe financial crisis, and served to demonstrate both Mr. Ford&apos;s antipathy to bankers, and his resourcefulness. When it became
                                                        acute the company had obligations of $58,000,000 due between Jan. 1 and April 18, and only $20,000,000 with which to meet them.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Investment bankers were convinced that he would have to go to them &quot;hat in hand,&quot; and an officer of one large New York bank journeyed to Detroit to offer Mr. Ford a large loan on the condition that a representative of the bankers be appointed
                                                        treasurer of the Ford Motor Company with full control over its finances. Mr. Ford silently handed him his hat.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>He loaded up Ford dealers throughout the country with all the cars they could possibly handle and compelled them to pay cash, thereby adding nearly $25,000,000 to the funds in hand. Then, by purchasing
                                                        a railroad of his own, the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton, and by other economies, he cut one-third from the time his raw materials and finished products were in transit. Thereby he was able to decrease
                                                        by one-third the inventory of goods he needed on hand for uninterrupted production, and to release $28,000,000 from capital funds to ready cash.</p>

                                                    <p>In addition he realized nearly $8,000,000 from the sale of Liberty bonds, nearly $4,000,000 from the sale of by-products and $3,000,000 in collections from Ford agents in foreign countries.</p>
                                                    <p>On April 1, consequently, he had more than $87,000,000 in cash, or $27,000,000 more than he needed to wipe out all the indebtedness. Furthermore, by rigid economies of labor and materials hitherto thought
                                                        impossible, he cut the overhead cost on each car from $146 to $93.

In fact, he became a competitor of the banks, frequently loaning several millions on call in the New York money market. He made a practice of carrying tremendous
                                                        amounts on deposit in banks throughout the United States and in other countries. Bankers reported that he invariably drove a hard bargain in placing these funds. He often exacted a special rate of
                                                        interest when his balance was to be above a certain amount for a certain time.

                                                        He attempted in vain to interest the younger generation in old-fashioned dances and fiddlers. In 1923 he purchased the Wayside Inn at South Sudbury, Mass., which had been the subject of Longfellow&apos;s
                                                        &quot;Tales of a Wayside Inn,&quot; and restored it.

                                                        the way to greater prosperity than that which the country then enjoyed and which he attributed to the eight-hour day and high wages, because they gave people time and money to consume the goods they
                                                        produced. Without the five-day week, he said, the country would not be able to absorb the results of mass production and remain prosperous.

                                                        car, manufactured by the General Motors Corporation, had become a serious competitor. Its production mounted from 25,000 in January, 1926, to 77,000 in November, while Ford sales dropped.</p>
                                                    <p>Mr. Ford closed his plants late in 1926 while he experimented with a six-cylinder model. He finally abandoned the Model T the next year, substituting the Model A, which became almost as well known. To
                                                        produce the new model Mr. Ford had to make over almost his entire system of production, retooling his plants and retraining his workers, a feat of industrial renovation which many experts had contended
                                                        would prove impossible.

                                                    <p>The new model proved popular with the buying public, and the Ford Motor Company continued to expand. In 1928 Mr. Ford organized the British Ford Company, and subsequently began operations in other European
                                                        countries. In Germany the German Ford Company was organized with the German dye trust as one of its principal stockholders.</p>

                                                        of that country, which was to prove of such importance in later years.

                                                    <p>When the stock market collapse of October, 1929, precipitated the great depression, Mr. Ford was one of the business and industrial leaders who were summoned to the White House by President Hoover. Unlike
                                                        some industrialists who favored deflation of wages, Mr. Ford argued that the maintenance of purchasing power was of paramount importance.</p>
                                                    <p>Although the Ford Motor Company lost as much as $68,000,000 in a single depression year, Mr. Ford maintained his wage policy until the autumn of 1932, when it announced a readjustment from &quot;the
                                                        highest executive down to the ordinary laborer,&quot; including a new minimum wage scale of $4 a day, $1 less than that which he had put into effect eighteen years before. As the depression waned,
                                                        however, he reverted to his high-wage policy and in 1935 established a minimum of $6 a day.

                                                        Finance Corporation, opened another new bank, the National Bank of Detroit.</p>

                                                    <p>Mr. Ford, who had supported Herbert Hoover for re-election in 1932, was regarded as one of the leading foes of the New Deal in the early days of President Roosevelt&apos;s Administration, and he refused
                                                        to sign the automobile code of the National Recovery Administration, which stipulated that employees had a right to organize. In 1936 he supported Gov. Alf M. Landon, stating that the election would
                                                        &quot;determine if labor and industry in this country can continue under a system of free enterprise.&quot;
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Despite Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s triumphant re-election with the strong support of the Committee for Industrial Organization, then headed by John L. Lewis, Mr. Ford remained outspokenly antagonistic to unions.
                                                        In an interview on Feb. 19, 1937, he advised all workers to &quot;stay out of unions.&quot; At the same time he declared that no group of strikers would ever take over a Ford plant.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The United Automobile Workers, a CIO union, began a vigorous drive to organize the workers in the Ford plants. The opening blow was a sit-down strike in the Ford plant in Kansas City, ended only by the
                                                        promise of officials there to treat with the union, a step the Ford company had never taken before. Other sporadic strikes occurred in Ford plants in other sections of the country.

                                                        Mr. Ford fought back with the argument that his policy of high wages and short hours was satisfactory to the bulk of the workers in his plants. He charged that a group of international financiers had gained control of the unions and were utilizing their
                                                        power to exploit labor and management alike.

UAW Won 70% Votes After NLRB Ordered Election

                                                    <p>On May 26, 1937, a group of UAW organizers, including Richard T. Frankensteen and Walter Reuther, were distributing organizing literature outside the gate of the Ford plant at River Rouge, when they
                                                        were set upon and badly beaten. The union charged that the beatings were administered by Ford company police. The Ford Motor Company denied this.</p>
                                                    <p>After lengthy hearings the National Labor Relations Board found the Ford Motor Company guilty of unfair labor practices. The Ford company fought the issue through the courts to the United States Supreme
                                                        Court, which, in effect, upheld the finding by refusing to review it. In April, 1941, the UAW called a strike in the Ford plants and the NLRB held an election under the Wagner Act to determine the
                                                        collective bargaining spokesman for the employes.</p>
                                                    <p>When the votes were counted in June, 1941, the UAW was found to have won about 70 per cent of them. With characteristic vigor, Mr. Ford, long looked upon as perhaps the strongest foe of unionism, did
                                                        a complete about face. He signed a contract with the union which gave them virtually everything for which they had asked, including a union shop and a dues check-off system.

He compelled the cancellation of a contract made by his son, Edsel, calling
                                                        for the production of 6,000 Rolls- Royce engines for Great Britain, and 3,000 of the same type for the United States.

                                                    <p>To support his contention that the United States was in no danger Mr. Ford, in May, 1940, stated that if it should become necessary the Ford Motor Company could &quot;under our own supervision, and without
                                                        meddling by Government agencies, swing into the production of a thousand airplanes of standard design a day.&quot; As the pressure for re-armament became greater, Mr. Ford was compelled by public
                                                        opinion to agree to build planes for the United States.

                                                    <p>Ground was broken for the plant on April 18, 1941, and the first of the thirty-ton B-24-E bombers came off its assembly line a little more than a year later, in May, 1942. For a time the plant was under

                                                        one an hour, twenty-four hours a day.</p>

                                                        had been considered for years as its greatest production expert, announced his retirement from the company. Not long after that Mr. Ford&apos;s personal secretary, Ernest G. Liebold, was dismissed,
                                                        after having been one of the company&apos;s top executives for many years.

                                                        ground that he was needed in the executive end of the business. Mr. Ford let it be known that he was grooming his grandson and namesake, then 26 years old, for the eventual leadership of the business.

                                                        He was opposed to the use of tobacco and liquor, and he hated idling.

                                                        the Government would allow him to do so, Mr. Ford said:</p>

If the men in our plants will give a full day&apos;s work for a full day&apos;s pay, there is no reason why we can&apos;t always do it. Every man should make enough money
                                                        to own a home, a piece of land and a car.&quot;

                                                        Mr. Ford was an ardent collector of Americana. In 1928 he established, and endowed with $5,000,000 a museum at Dearborn to commemorate the inventions of his old friend, Thomas A. Edison. The Menlo Park Laboratory, in which Mr. Edison perfected the electric

                                                    <p>Mr. Ford also built Greenfield Village, a reproduction of the community in which Mrs. Ford, who was Clara Bryant before their marriage in 1887, was born. There he brought the original log cabin in which

                                                        to him its Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts in behalf of disabled veterans of both world wars.</p>
