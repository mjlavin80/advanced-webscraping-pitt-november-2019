                                                    <p>
                                                        Gerard Swope, former president of the General Electric Company and onetime chairman of the New York City Housing Authority, died yesterday at his home, 161 East Seventy-ninth Street. He was 84 years old.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Although retired, Mr. Swope kept office hours until last Friday, when he became ill with a cold. He died of pneumonia.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Until last December he resided at his estate, The Croft, near Ossining, N.Y. Up to three years ago he was a familiar figure riding horseback early every morning along bridle trails in the area.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Mr. Swope&apos;s fascination with electricity started in his early childhood. As a boy in St.. Louis where he was born Dec. 1, 1872 he tinkered with electric toys and appliances, and read books on the subject.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        In his high school days he drew plans for a motor. His father, Isaac Swope, a watchcase manufacturer, purchased the necessary casings. To the surprise of his family, the motor actually worked, and the decision was made to send him to Massachusetts Institute
                                                        of Technology.

Lacking funds, he obtained a daytime job--&quot;it was a dirty, oily job,&quot; he said later--with General Electric
                                                        in Chicago, and visited the fair in the evenings.</p>

                                                        Thus did his name enter, for the first time, the books of the company he later was to head. &quot;Swope, G., helper, per day, $1,&quot; the notation read.

                                                        Two years later, he graduated from M. I. T. with a degree in electrical engineering. Times were hard, but a foreman for the Western Electric Company grudgingly put him to work pulling transformers apart in the company&apos;s Chicago plant--again at $1

Two years later he was general sales manager in the New York office. He became a vice president and director in charge of commercial work in the United

For this service he received the Distinguished Service Medal from this country, the Order of the Rising Sun from
                                                        Japan and was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor.

Before 1922 the only product it sold directly to the public on the basis of mass production and wide distribution was the incandescent electric lamp. Its principal products had been
                                                        apparatus for generating, transmitting and controlling electricity. Under Mr. Swope&apos;s direction the company began extensive manufacture of electric appliances for home use.
