                                                    <h5>By PETER B. FLINT</h5>
                                                    <p>Alfred Hitchcock, whose mastery of suspense and of directing technique made him one of the most popular and celebrated of film makers, died yesterday at the age of 80 at his home in Los Angeles. Mr.
                                                        Hitchcock, ailing with arthritis and kidney failures, had been in declining health for a year.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>In a characteristically incisive remark, Mr. Hitchcock once summed up his approach to moviemaking: &quot;Some films are slices of life, mine are slices of cake.&quot; The director of scores of psychological
                                                        thrillers for more than half a century was the master manipulator of menace and the macabre, and the leading specialist in suspense and shock.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>His best movies were meticulously orchestrated nightmares of peril and pursuit relieved by unexpected comic ironies, absurdities and anomalies. Films made by the portly, cherubic director invariably
                                                        progressed from deceptively commonplace trifles of life to shattering revelations, and with elegant style and structure, he pervaded mundane events and scenes with a haunting mood of mounting anxiety.</p>
                                                    <p>In delicately balancing the commonplace and the bizarre, he was the most noted juggler of emotions in the longest major directorial career in film history. His distinctive style was vigorously visual,
                                                        always stressing imagery over dialogue and often using silence to increase apprehension. Among his most stunning montages were a harrowing attack by a bullet-firing crop-dusting plane on Cary Grant
                                                        at a deserted crossroad amid barren cornfields in &quot;North by Northwest,&quot; a brutal shower-slaying in &quot;Psycho&quot; and an avian assault on a sleepy village in &quot;The Birds.&quot;
                                                    </p>

                                                        A favorite Hitchcock theme centered on &quot;the wrong man&quot; who was unjustly accused of a crime and hunted by both the villains and the police because of mistaken identity or incriminating information he inadvertently acquired. The storyteller sought
                                                        consistently to freshen the concept with novel variations and plot twists and to avoid cliches in a careerlong effort to refine his style and enrich his films.

He had a profound knowledge of all aspects of moviemaking, and wrote the production section for the Encyclopedia Britannica. He made expert use of objects, placing, for example,

Working with his screenwriter for months, he freely adapted material, writing up to 100-page shot schedules without dialogue. He almost never looked through

He graduated from St. Ignatius College, a Jesuit school in London, where he studied engineering, and took art

At about the age of 5, he was sent by his father with a note to a local police chief, who locked him in a cell for five minutes. In releasing
                                                        him, the officer said, &quot;That&apos;s what we do to naughty boys.&quot; Mr. Hitchcock later said he could never forget &quot;the sound and the solidity of that closing cell door and the bolt.&quot;

                                                        The pictorial and technical innovations of Mr. Hitchcock&apos;s early melodramas garnered him increasing praise. In 1929, he directed &quot;Blackmail,&quot; Britain&apos;s first widely successful talking feature. In the 30&apos;s, he won international
                                                        acclaim for his pacesetting spy thrillers, including &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;; &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;; &quot;Secret Agent&quot;; &quot;Sabotage,&quot; called &quot;The Woman Alone&quot;
                                                        in the United States, and &quot;The Lady Vanishes.&quot;

Lured to Hollywood</b>

                                                        David O. Selznick lured Mr. Hitchcock to Hollywood, with its incomparable technical facilities, and he stayed, becoming an American citizen. His first American production, the adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&apos;s Gothic novel &quot;Rebecca,&quot; with
                                                        Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, began a long string of successes.

                                                        In the film maker&apos;s early years in Hollywood, he created a stir when he quipped that &quot;all actors are children&quot; and &quot;should be treated like cattle.&quot; He later showed particular disdain for Method school actors. But he never raised
                                                        his voice on a set and never argued with a performer in front of the crew. A number of stars later described him as a vividly persuasive man who knew exactly what he wanted in a picture--and got
                                                        it.

                                                        Despite his recent illness, the director was reportedly at work at Universal Studios on a new film, a spy story to be called &quot;The Short Night.&quot; With him at his death were his wife, Alma; his daughter, Patricia, and his three grandchildren. In
                                                        the last year of his life, Mr. Hitchcock, although a United States citizen, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of his native Britain.

                                                        In contrast with the disordered Hitchcockian cinema world, the moviemaker&apos;s personal life was routinized, stable and serene. Unless he was shooting a film or out promoting one, he rarely ventured away from his home or office, according to Richard
                                                        Schickel, who interviewed him for a public-television series, &quot;The Men Who Made the Movies,&quot; in 1975.

                                                        The director had a measured, courtly manner and wore dark suits, white shirts and conservative narrow ties. He was a gourmet and wine connoisseur, and, with a 5-foot-8-inch frame, his weight once soared to 290 pounds, though he tried to keep it down by
                                                        dieting to about 220 pounds. He avoided exercise and fiction, and voraciously read contemporary biographies, travel books and true- crime accounts. He increased his fame and fortune by lending his
                                                        name to, and supervising for decades, popular suspense anthologies and magazines with tales by many writers.

                                                        Mr. Hitchcock was a noted practical joker whose favorite prank was telling a tantalizing story in a loud voice to a companion in an elevator, perfectly timing his exit just before the punch line and then bowing politely to the intrigued but frustrated
                                                        passengers.
